Here's what she said:</p><ul><li><strong>Collect your holographic cards first:</strong> They're the most value and there are three different types: s<span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">ome cards have just the Pokemon image holographic, there are some where the edges are holos, while some cards are holos as a whole.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Sit on the cards for a while:</strong> It could be worth just holding on to the cards for ten years to (hopefully) see them increase in value.</li><li><strong>Keep them in mint condition:</strong> You can buy Pokemon books with sleeves that you can keep them in, so they don't get damaged.</li><li><strong>Get them PSA rated:</strong> The Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) grades cards and verifies their authenticity, but you have to pay for its service. The PSA is an American organisation, but you can also get cards graded using services in the UK such as <a data-mce-href=https://www.ludkinscollectables.com/psa-grading href=#>Ludkins Collectables</a> and <a data-mce-href=http://vintagetradingcards.co.uk/psagrading.htm href=#>Vintage Trading Cards</a>. Just make sure to double-check the prices in advance so you're not spending more than your card might be worth.</li></ul><p><strong>If you want to sell your cards:</strong></p><ul><li>Find out how much your card is worth to a collector by checking the same or similar Pokemon cards under "sold listings" on eBay.</li><li>Compare your Pokemon card to other higher selling auctions and ask yourself if it’s in a similar condition.</li><li>Look at things such as conditions, release date and whether or not it is still in its original packaging.</li><li>If it’s in mint condition then it might be worth selling it through an auction house or directly to a collectables website. If it’s not, it’s probably worth sticking it on eBay for a moderate sum.</li></ul><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">TOP STORIES IN GAMING</h2></p><p>In other news, <a href=#>Call of Duty Modern Warfare</a> players have been left furious as the new game mysteriously crashing on Xbox.</p><p>Pro gamer Shroud has ditched 7million Twitch fans for rival app Mixer – after Ninja did same <a href=#>for ‘£6million a year’</a>.</p><p>And, here's how kids are racking up bills worth thousands <a href=#>buying ‘loot boxes’</a> on games like Fifa and Minecraft.</p><p>Do you have a Pokemon card collection?
