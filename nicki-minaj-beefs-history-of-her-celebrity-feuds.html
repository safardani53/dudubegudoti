So, naturally, she's had her fair share of feuds with other celebs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "Barbie Dreams" rapper has sparred with the likes of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Mariah Carey</a> and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, in April 2016, Minaj told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ellen DeGeneres</a> that she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>regrets her past feuds</a> with fellow stars, saying, "I'm a sweet person, and I don't wanna be mean to people." Nonetheless, that hasn't stopped Minaj from carrying on the occasional feud.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here is a list of stars who've found themselves on the rapper's bad side.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cardi-b></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cardi B</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty; (2)</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>first hints of tension</a> between the pair began in the spring of 2017 when Minaj appeared to "like" a fan's Instagram comment dismissing one of <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Cardi B</a>'s rap verses. Things began to escalate the following summer after Cardi's breakout single "Bodak Yellow" topped the charts and she signed with Atlantic Records.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rumors of a feud continued to swirl as Minaj and Cardi offered guest vocals on various singles that could be construed as shade at the other — but both denied there was any bad blood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I mean, I don't really want problems with anybody," Cardi told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Billboard</a> in August 2017. "I don't really got to do that whole industry beef."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Minaj, the real beef began when they teamed up with Migos on "MotorSport" in October 2017. At the time, Cardi said in an interview that some lines in the track were changed last-minute before its release.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/MG18/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The only thing with Cardi that really, really, really hurt my feelings was the first interview she did after 'MotorSport' came out," Minaj said in a Beats 1 radio interview in April 2018. "The first interview she did after 'MotorSport' came out, it just really hurt me. She looked so aggravated and angry and the only thing she said was, 'Oh, I didn't hear that. I didn't hear that verse.' I was like, what?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A month later, the beef appeared to be squashed when Cardi and Minaj were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>photographed having what looked like a heart-to-heart</a> at the Met Gala.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I never was feuding with anybody; there was a misunderstanding," Cardi later told Howard Stern of the meeting. "It's just something that had to be talked about because it was an issue."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their tiff reignited in August 2018 when Minaj addressed Cardi on her Beats 1 Queen Radio show.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images; Theo Wargo/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn't know Cardi and I had an issue. To me, she may have taken an issue with things that I've said, but I'm not going to bite my tongue," Minaj said. "You gotta have thick skin. People talk s--- about me all the time. I don't go around and tell people to stop posting me because I see one bad thing about myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after, Cardi revealed that someone — seemingly Minaj — had blocked her on Twitter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then, Cardi and Minaj's cold war finally boiled over into an all-out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>physical altercation at Harper's Bazaar's ICONS party</a> in N.Y.C. on Sept. 7, 2018. While the source said it initially looked like Cardi and Minaj "might hug it out" inside the party, suddenly "it all went down."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Cardi walked towards Nicki and all of a sudden Cardi started screaming something about her child. She was yelling, 'Bitch you feisty. Bitch don't talk s--- about my child' at Nicki," the source recalled about Cardi, who is mom to daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kulture Kiari</a> with husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Offset</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steven Ferdman/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Immediately following the incident, Cardi was escorted out by security while Minaj stayed inside. Cardi was seen leaving the party with a large lump on her forehead but no shoes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>She left barefoot with her dress ripped and butt out</a>," the source said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cardi later wrote a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>long scathing Instagram post</a> that did not mention Minaj by name but suggested Minaj had tried to sabotage Cardi's career and also spoken badly about Kulture Kiari.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Sept. 10, 2018, Minaj <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>addressed the altercation on her <i>Queen</i> Radio show</a>: "The other night I was part of something <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>so mortifying and so humiliating</a> to go through in front of a bunch upper echelon people who have their life together. I was in a Gaultier gown — off the motherf------ runway — and I could not believe how humiliated we all felt." Minaj also went on to deny that she had ever spoken ill of Cardi's infant daughter.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-remy-ma></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Remy Ma</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jamie McCarthy/Getty;Jerritt Clark/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Minaj and Terror Squad rapper <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Remy Ma</a> have been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>feuding for years</a> — Minaj supposedly dissed Remy Ma on her track "Dirty Money" off a 2007 EP, in which she raps, "Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown" while sampling one of Ma's Terror Squad songs, "Yeah Yeah Yeah." Their rivalry reached another level in February 2017 when Ma dropped "ShETHER," a 7-minute long diss track in which she accused Minaj of everything from infidelity to getting plastic surgery, which promptly set the Internet on fire and blew up the charts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2017, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Minaj responded by dropping three tracks</a>, including "No Frauds," in which she teamed up with her Young Money label mates <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Drake</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Lil Wayne</a>. "You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin' / What the f--- is this bitch inhalin'? / Tried to drop 'Another One,' you was itchin' to scrap / You exposed your ghostwriter / Now you wish it was scrapped," Minaj rapped on the track (which alludes to "Another One," Ma's follow-up single, which didn't get the same rapturous reception as "ShETHER"), before issuing a challenge to her rap rival.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The greats took three months to respond to diss records. Queens don't move on peasant time," Minaj wrote in a now-deleted Instagram post, addressing the two weeks that she waited before responding. "Queens shut down Paris, then drop hits on #QueenTime… Been writing my own raps since I was 11. God knows. Next week I'll beat <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aretha [Franklin]</a> for the most Hot 100 hits on Billboard by ANY woman in the world EVER in the history of music. Stay in your bum ass place. Jealousy gets you nowhere."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added a challenge to Remy Ma, too: "Now I got a countdown of my own for Sheneneh. You got 72 hours to drop a hit and I'll give you half a million dollars if you can book ANY show or interview without mentioning the Queen name."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just as the bitter war of bars began to die down, both rappers fueled the feud fire in separate performances in June 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the BET Awards, Remy Ma took a shot at her rap rival as she took home the award for best female hip hop artist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Y'all bitches got fat while we starved / Shots in your ass, pads in your bras," she rapped on stage. "Y'all some liars / It ain't no facts in your songs / And yeah, that crown is coming back to the Bronx."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Minaj teamed up with 2 Chainz to perform their collab "Realize," in which the superstar didn't hold back when firing out her verse during the inaugural <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>NBA Awards</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You dude wrote an ether record / but I broke Aretha record," Minaj rapped on stage.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-taylor-swift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Taylor Swift</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images; Clint Spaulding/WWD/REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It all started with a tweet. Swift and Minaj had a heated exchange on the social media site after the rapper <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>spoke out</a> about her lack of a nomination for video of the year at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, seemingly referencing Swift's nomination.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift, who was the only female to receive a nomination in that category, responded to Minaj's tweet, accusing the star of pitting "women against each other."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Minaj noted that she made no mention of the "Style" singer, and Swift soon called a truce in a follow-up post, writing, "If I win, please come up with me!!" (Swift ended up taking home the award.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "Blank Space" singer later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tweeted an apology</a> to the rap star, writing that she "missed the point" of Minaj's tweets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two seemed to put all the "Bad Blood" behind them when Swift joined Minaj on the VMA stage in a show-stopping performance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It appeared the feud might spark again in 2017 after Minaj appeared as a featured guest on one-time Swift frenemy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katy Perry</a>'s single "Swish Swish." Later that summer, Minaj mysteriously tweeted "N----- sit down. Be humble," the day that Swift released her single "Look What You Made Me Do." However, though fans of both artists thought it was a reference to Swift, the comment did not amount to anything.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Any semblance of a feud was long over by October 2022, when Minaj <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>congratulated Swift on Twitter</a> for breaking Spotify's record for most-streamed album in a single day after the release of Swift's album Midnights.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-miley-cyrus></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>John Shearer/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Proving that she is not one to back down, Minaj confronted Cyrus at the 2015 VMAs (Cyrus hosted the award show) after the "Wrecking Ball" singer called her "not too kind" while commenting on the Minaj-Swift exchange in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The </a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>New York Times</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Now, back to this bitch that had a lot to say about me the other day in the press," Minaj said after taking to the stage to receive the award for best hip-hop video. "Miley, what's good?" (a source later claimed that Minaj was joking).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cyrus quickly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tried to defend herself</a>, telling Minaj, "We all do interviews.

Minaj said of Cyrus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Years later, Cyrus released the song "Cattitude" in May 2019, which features the lyric, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"I love you Nicki, but I listen to Cardi,"</a> a clear reference to the Minaj-Cardi feud.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Minaj responded to Cyrus' diss</a> by saying, "A Perdue chicken can never talk s--- about queens," Minaj said in response to a question about Cyrus. "But I do notice a lot of Perdue chickens recently have been trying to say the queen's name for clout. And that's always been happening."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The rapper added: "That's what [Cyrus] did in the first place.
