Funches voiced her displeasure with Wade’s petition to officially alter Zaya’s name for a variety of reasons, as stated in court filings.&nbsp;Wade, according to Funches, hopes to benefit from Zaya’s name and gender changes via relationships and marketing possibilities with other firms, including Disney. Funches is now concerned that Wade will put pressure on their kid to consent to a name and gender change in order for him to take advantage of the chances he has gotten from various firms.</p><p>Siohvaughn remembered a meeting with Dwyane in April 2022, during which the latter allegedly informed her that she could make a lot of money off of Zaya’s name and gender difficulties. She stated:</p><p>“[Wade] advised me that he wanted to make our kid extremely famous because of the name and gender problem and that there would be endorsements/contracts linked with it.”</p><p>Funches, who mentioned her daughter’s dead name in the declaration, also claimed that now that Zaya’s transition has been made public, she will face a lot of media pressure.&nbsp;She also said that Zaya must make the option to associate with businesses based on her gender when she reaches the right age in two and a half years. Dwyane has yet to react to his ex-court wife’s paperwork, and neither the former couple’s reps nor lawyers have spoken.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dwyane-Wade-1.jpg alt="Dwyane Wade" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wade had the right, according to Wade’s petition in August of this year, to seek Zaya’s official name change without her mother’s agreement. Later, he stated that Funches was notified of his petition as a courtesy.</p><h2>Siohvaughn Funches is the creator of the ‘A Woman’s Worth Foundation,’ which assists women in overcoming domestic abuse.</h2><p>Siohvaughn Funches, who was born on September 6, 1981, grew raised in Chicago with her sister Garrica LeAnna Woods. She went through a difficult period in her youth when her parents divorced when she was three years old. She enrolled at and graduated from Harold L. Richards High School. Following that, she moved to Wisconsin with Dwyane Wade and enrolled at Marquette University.&nbsp;Siohvaughn and Dwyane originally met in fifth grade and started dating when Funches was 15 years old. They had a son, Zaire Dwyane Wade, in February 2002 and married in May 2002, during their second year. Despite financial difficulties throughout their marriage, Funches did all she could to help Wade’s basketball career. She also took a pair of shoes from a retailer when Wade couldn’t afford them.</p><p></p><p>The duo was often seen at red carpet-events. Zion Malachi Airamis, their second son, was born in May 2007.&nbsp;Dwyane divorced Siohvaughn in 2007, and the divorce was completed in 2010. Dwyane was awarded full custody of the children, and Funches was permitted to visit on a regular basis. Wade was requested to pay Funches $5.125 million as part of their divorce settlement in 2013, and Funches also received a home and four automobiles from Wade.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dwyane-Wade-2.jpg alt="Dwyane Wade" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Siohvaughn Funches started A Woman’s Worth Foundation in 2006 and is currently its president.
