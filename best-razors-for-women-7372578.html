This practice — called dermaplaning — has been in place for ages (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Elizabeth Taylor</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Marilyn Monroe</a> are rumored to have done it). It's a process where you run a razor blade along the skin in short, controlled movements to remove vellus (or peach fuzz) and dead skin cells. The exfoliation helps your skin to look more even-toned and allows skincare products like your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>facial moisturizer</a> to penetrate deeper and your complexion products like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>makeup or foundation</a> to sit better on the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rachel Nazarian, MD, FAAD notes that the upkeep is quite frequent: "Most people need monthly treatments (sometimes more or less often depending on rate of hair growth)," she explains. While it's safest to have this treatment done by a professional, with a bit of practice, you can reap the benefits of dermaplaning at home. Nazarian notes that the tool used in-office is essentially identical to those you can purchase in stores — just be sure you are properly sterilizing the blade between uses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers tried out some of the best dermaplaning tools available, looking at comfort (and safety!), ease of use, and how effective they were at removing hair and exfoliating skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Below, we're sharing our favorites.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-tweezerman-facial-razor></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tweezerman Facial Razor</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tweezerman Facial Razor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/xhr82i9E0xxJA48Q9pKfNpqpOqk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tweezerman-Facial-Razor-a4e51ef739e541b59b7529f8e9ae57b4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Extremely sharp</p></li><li><p>Not great for beginners</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Earning a perfect score in ease-of-use, post-treatment skin results, and overall performance, the Tweezerman Facial Razor passed our tests with flying colors. Our testers loved how easily it maneuvered around their faces. One said, "The actual weight of the product felt very professional and smooth.

As someone with sensitive and acne-prone skin, our tester appreciated that this razor didn't cause any discomfort or irritation, though she did note some redness on the untouched side of her face after use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Tweezerman razor is compact, made with a durable and rust-resistant stainless steel blade, and is affordably-priced. We love this razor for regular facial touch ups, which should happen every four to six weeks, according to skin experts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Blade Material: </strong>Stainless Steel | <strong>Safety Features: </strong>Safety cap for storage | <strong>Uses:</strong> Removes peach fuzz, dead skin | <strong>Replacement Blades Included:</strong> Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-skin-camp-dermaplaning-beauty-wand></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skin Camp Dermaplaning Beauty Wand</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skin Camp Dermaplaning Beauty Wand" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/1UFDs4oiahu-p0yh1ydi39qoAP4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skin-camp-dermaplaning-beauty-wand-a592120500804d0b95bf436c5b2759b8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Post Treatment</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Budget-friendly option, costing just $5</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Has a solid grip that was easy to maneuver around the face</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester compared this dermaplaning tool to a pocket knife because it folds up when you're not using it to keep the blade concealed. As a dermaplaning newbie, she was a little nervous, but appreciated how strong the grip was. "This was an easy tool to use, considering it was my first time," she said, adding that it was "easy to move up and down [her] cheeks."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made from a lightweight plastic, this tool is designed with a shape that's easy to hold in your hand.

This blade is also slightly duller than others on our list, so while it helps with safety, it also might take a few more passes across your face, which could contribute to post-treatment redness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That being said, it creates a smooth texture on your skin, comes with two additional razors, and sells at an affordable price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Blade Material: </strong>N/A | <strong>Safety Features: </strong>Collapsible safety handle | <strong>Uses:</strong> Removes dead skin and peach fuzz, brow shaping | <strong>Replacement Blades Included:</strong> Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-dermaflash-luxe-anti-aging-exfoliation--peach-fuzz-dermaplaning-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Splurge</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dermaflash Luxe+ Dermaplaning Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermaflash Luxe Anti-Aging Dermaplaning Exfoliation Device displayed in front of a white background " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Lkzz1IAMk8JySwKWxwZSMTRVhBE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dermaflash-luxe-anti-aging-dermaplaning-exfoliation-device-1cac2db7701448bfb74c4b34d6526bc3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bring the spa home to you with the Dermaflash Luxe Device. Though it certainly isn't a budget-friendly option, the results may be worth the investment. This set comes with the tool and two skin products — a pre-treatment cleanser and post-treatment moisturizer. The tool uses proprietary sonic technology to safely and gently remove peach fuzz by quickly vibrating to get as close to the root as possible. And if you're worried about nicks, it comes with a "Microfine Edge" to guard and protect the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester loved the thickness of this rechargeable machine, and said it "allowed for a nice grip and comfort while swiping." Her skin felt the "softest it's ever been" after using this tool, and that was before applying the moisturizer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She didn't love the price, and considering the added cost of replacement blades, this tool is rather expensive. But our tester conceded, "I can't rate it low because it did its job the best out of all the ones I've used before."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Blade Material: </strong>Stainless Steel | <strong>Safety Features: </strong>Blade is concealed when not in use | <strong>Uses:</strong> Removes peach fuzz, dead skin, smooths skin texture | <strong>Replacement Blades Included:</strong> Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-peach-fuzz-sephora-collection-metal-facial-razor></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Peach Fuzz</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sephora Collection Metal Facial Razor</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Collection Metal Facial Razor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KI_EC_3bEpQWQAcRCuUC7xf6zp0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sephora-collection-metal-facial-razor-03e478a806ed400e8bb1e6e4d3bee9bb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Post Treatment</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Ergonomic design</p></li><li><p>Easy to grip</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Extremely sharp</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beloved for its feel and ergonomic design, this razor has a little finger divot on the side that makes it perfect for gripping.

"It left my skin with a smooth, glowing finish," she said, adding how much of a feat that is due to her sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though this razor is very sharp, it never irritated our tester's skin, even on dry patches.

If you regularly use exfoliation or acidic skincare products, Marissa Perman, MD suggests pausing your routine leading up to your dermaplaning session. She also says to be mindful of what products you use after dermaplaning because your skin will absorb them better.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Grip</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You're dealing with a sharp blade, so you'll want a tool with a solid grip so you can hold it steadily as it glides across your skin.
