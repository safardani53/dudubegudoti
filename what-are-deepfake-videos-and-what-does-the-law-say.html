itemprop=articleBody><p>DEEPFAKES have become more commonplace in peoples' newsfeeds and as technology continues to evolve, the harder it is to differentiate what is reality.</p><p>The legality surrounding the manipulative imagery has been brought into question as <a href=#>deepfakes</a> can be used to deceive audiences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/10jpg-JS639798835.jpg><h2>What are Deepfake videos?</h2><p><a href=#>Deepfake videos</a> are made using a blend of <a href=#>artificial intelligence</a> and computer imagery to create a manipulated version of a real person.</p><p>The technology can create convincing but fictional photos or videos from scratch.</p><p>Voice clones are usually dubbed into the video to make it more authentic too.</p><p>The term "deepfake" comes from the underlying artificial intelligence technology called "deep learning".</p><p>There are several ways to make deepfakes but the most common method uses deep neural networks involving autoencoders to create a face swap.</p><p>An example of a&nbsp;<a href=#>fake video</a> is one created in 2019 of <a href=#>Boris Johnson</a>.</p><p>The clip emerged online to show the then-prime minister and <a href=#>Jeremy Corbyn</a> <a href=#>endorsing each other to lead the UK.</a></p><p>In the deepfake he is seen saying: "My friends, I wish to rise above [divisions over <a href=#>Brexit</a>] and endorse my worthy opponent, the Right Honourable Jeremy Corbyn."</p><p>In the then-<a href=#>Labour</a> leader's clip, he appears to say: "I'm urging all Labour members and supporters to... back Boris Johnson to continue as our prime minster."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Capture-17.png><p>Another example includes a clip from 2019, which was doctored to show <a href=#>Facebook</a> CEO <a href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a> discussing stolen data.</p><p><a href=#>Zuckerburg's voice</a>, which was replaced by an actor, says: "Imagine this for one second.</p><p>"One man, with total control of billions of people's stolen data, all their secrets, their lives, their futures."</p><p>As time goes on, experts claim deepfakes will become more sophisticated and might introduce serious threats to the public relating to <a href=#>election</a> interference, political tension, and <a href=#>criminal</a> activity.</p><h2>What have social media companies said about the videos?</h2><p>When the Zuckerberg deepfake emerged in 2019, <a href=#>Instagram</a> resisted calls to take the clip down.</p><p>Speaking at the time, <a href=#>Adam Mosseri</a>, head of Instagram, said removing the doctored clips was "inappropriate".</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He told CBS</a>: "I don't feel good about it."</p><p>Mosseri said Instagram would not remove the videos because the company had not yet come up with an official policy on AI-altered videos.</p><p>He said:&nbsp;"We are trying to evaluate if we wanted to do that and if so, how you would define deepfakes.</p><p>"If a million people see a video like that in the first 24 hours or the first 48 hours, the damage is done.</p><p>"So that conversation, though very important, currently, is moot."</p><p>Three-years-ago, Facebook banned deepfake videos that were likely to mislead viewers in the run-up to the <a href=#>2020 US election</a>.</p><p>However, the policy only covered misinformation produced using AI.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Vox</a>, Twitter was also taking steps to ban harmful deepfakes.</p><h2>Are the videos legal?</h2><p>Deepfake videos are legal.</p><p>However, depending on what is contained in the video they could potentially breach legal codes.</p><p>For example, if they are <a href=#>pornographic face-swap videos</a> or photos, the <a href=#>victim will be able to claim defamation or copyright</a>.</p><p>In 2022, the <a href=#>BBC</a> reported a planned new law would make sharing <a href=#>pornographic deepfakes</a> without consent a crime in England and Wales.</p><p>But as it stands, it is not illegal to create deepfake videos of celebrities making fake controversial statements.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Deepfakes – what are they, and how do they work?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Here's what you need to know...</p><ul><li>Deepfakes use artificial intelligence and machine learning to produce face-swapped videos with barely any effort</li><li>They can be used to create realistic videos that make celebrities appear as though they're saying something they didn't</li><li>Deepfakes have also been used by sickos to make fake porn videos that feature the faces of celebrities or ex-lovers</li><li>To create the videos, users first track down an XXX clip featuring a porn star that looks like an actress</li><li>They then feed an app with hundreds – and sometimes thousands – of photos of the victim's face</li><li>A machine learning algorithm swaps out the faces frame-by-frame until it spits out a realistic, but fake, video</li><li>To help other users create these videos, pervs upload "facesets", which are huge computer folders filled with a celebrity's face that can be easily fed through the "deepfakes" app</li><li>Simon Miles, of intellectual property specialists Edwin Coe, told The Sun that the fake sex tapes could be considered an "unlawful intrusion" into the privacy of a celeb</li><li>He also added that celebrities could request that the content be taken down, but warned: "The difficulty is that damage has already been done</li></ul><p class=postsid
