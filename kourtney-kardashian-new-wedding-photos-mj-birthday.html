In another photo, they could be seen going to a restaurant afterwards and raising champagne glasses together, presumably after the ceremony. Travis’ dad&nbsp;<strong>Randy&nbsp;</strong>was also there in a gray suit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In the caption, Kourtney wished her a happy birthday and showed how glad she was that she got to be there for her and Travis’ special day. “My special, sweet, chic, sophisticated, smart and most wonderful grandmother.

She wanted it super small and intimate and told MJ that she only wanted her there,” the insider said. Another source revealed that it was incredibly important for her to be there, after spending so much time away from the family due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now that she’s been out of isolation, Kourtney knew she wanted MJ to play a special role in her life,” they explained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FvZqSnpafBr7HYZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdkp52nYsSmsMOipaBloJ28tbvSZqSjZZKev7W0w5qwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
