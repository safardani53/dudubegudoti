As Offerman <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE Now</a> in 2020, "First and foremost we [make] each other laugh … I think that's at the heart of if any relationship is gonna survive, you have to be able to laugh about things."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We just got lucky," he added. "We adore each other. We're two human beings so it's a relationship that requires work and patience and maintenance. I'm sure I drive her up a tree sometimes and that's when I go and sleep out in the backyard. Then I write her a letter and she lets me back in the house."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Offerman and Mullally met in 2000, when they starred in the play The Berlin Circle. Mullally told New York magazine in 2010 that they weren't romantic until after previews, but once they started dating — spotting coyotes and a Glen Campbell concert at the Hollywood Bowl were part of their courtship — "it got serious and we were never apart from then on."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple got engaged in London in 2002 and married in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>surprise wedding</a> at their Los Angeles home in September 2003, on the night before the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Emmys</a>. Ever since, they've had a two-week rule when it comes to taking gigs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We made a deal that any job that's going to keep us apart for more than a couple of weeks, we discuss," Offerman told New York.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many of those jobs have been with each other. Though they've done plenty of projects apart, Offerman and Mullally have worked together well over a dozen times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fifteen years after The Berlin Circle, they received praise for their roles in the play, Annapurna. They've also appeared in each other's TV projects — Offerman guest-starred on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Will & Grace</a> and had a recurring role on Childrens Hospital, while Mullally played the recurring role of Tammy Swanson on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Parks and Recreation</a>. On the big screen, they've starred in nine movies together, including 2002's Stealing Harvard, 2012's Smashed, 2013's The Kings of Summer, 2015's Hotel Transylvania and 2017's Infinity Baby. Off-camera, they co-wrote the 2018 book The Greatest Story Ever Told and hosted a podcast, In Bed With Nick and Megan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It may seem like they're always working, but the couple does know how to slow down. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>My favorite thing to do is just stay home</a> with the dogs and read or watch movies and be together," Mullally told PEOPLE in 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We really like each other, and we try to treat each other well," she continued.

Mullally <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Buzzfeed</a> in 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, Mullally had wrapped season 2 of Will & Grace and Offerman was sleeping on a friend's basement couch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was pre-disposed to not be impressed by this TV lady. I didn't have a TV.

It was quite the roll of the dice that she rescued me from the squallor I was living in at the time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, Mullally was 41 and Offerman was 29, though Mullally initially assumed he was much older.

Offerman would later reappear on the Will & Grace revival, dating both Will and Grace in the new series' first season in 2018.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2002-nick-offerman-and-megan-mullally-get-engaged></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>2002: Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally get engaged</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mark Sullivan/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Offerman fake-proposed three times in Paris before officially popping the question. He told Playboy that the Will & Grace costume designer helped him with the bit by giving him faux disposable rings. Once they were in London, which the Making It co-host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told The Guardian</a> was "our favorite city in the world," he really did ask for Mullally's hand in marriage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was in Regent's Park that I bent my knee and presented my hand-carved, walnut, heart-shaped ring box," he said. "Magically, the ducks on the water and birds in the air began to furiously copulate all around us. Something made the moment bigger than the two of us. It was fated by Mother Nature."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Offerman described himself as being in a "heigtened state of agitation" ahead of the real proposal, which Mullally <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Playboy</a> she noticed. "I couldn't figure out what was up with him," Mullally said. "He was sucking and chewing on his mustache like crazy. I thought to myself, 'What is going on?

"Up until that point I'd felt like Megan's student and fan.
