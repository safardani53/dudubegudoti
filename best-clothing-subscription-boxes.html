However, online clothing subscription boxes help simplify the process by sending you curated outfits tailored to your size and style — often with convenient free shipping and returns. You can opt for a rental service that helps you cut down closet clutter, work with a stylist to curate wardrobe pieces for you to try then buy, or enjoy surprise boxes with yours-to-keep clothes. And besides clothes, you can find subscription boxes for jewelry, underwear, and socks as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Considering factors such as style, size range, and budget, below are the best clothing subscription boxes to help you update your wardrobe.

You'll find fits for men, women, and kids, with options for plus, maternity, petite, and tall sizes. Its collection also features over a thousand reputable brands, such as Kate Spade and Free People.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To get you started, a stylist picks out five pieces that suit your budget, fit, and personal style in your first Fix. There's a $20 styling fee, but this gets credited toward any pieces you buy from your Fix. After your first Fix, you can then choose the Freestyle option to browse clothes without a stylist. Do keep in mind that you only have three days to try on your clothes, and the company isn't technically a subscription service. This means you'll need to set up automatic deliveries for consistent service, whether you want shipments every two weeks or every quarter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Base Price: </strong>$20 styling fee | <strong>No. of Items per Box: </strong>5 | <strong>Free Shipping:</strong> Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-designer-rentals-rent-the-runway></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Designer Rentals: Rent the Runway</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rent the Runway</span></figure><span class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>Range of designer brands to choose from, including Saint Laurent and Paco Rabanne<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>Can switch out a few or all of your items with available shipments</p></li><li readability=0><p>Free shipping and returns, including complimentary pickups</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-it-made-the-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It Made the List</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to flex designer clothes but can't quite justify splurging on them, Rent the Runway offers a solution that won't put a dent in your bank account. Its vast rental collection of over 800 designers includes Saint Laurent, Paco Rabanne, Anna Sui, and other notable names, along with sizes ranging from 0 to 22.

All boxes ship free, and your clothes arrive dry-cleaned and ready to wear. After wearing your pieces, simply drop them off at UPS or schedule a complimentary home pickup if it's available in your area. If you can't part with an item, you can also buy clothes that you love at a lower price point thanks to member-exclusive discounts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Base Price: </strong>$94/month | <strong>No. of Items per Box: </strong>5 | <strong>Free Shipping:</strong> Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-professional-clothes-armoire></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Professional Clothes: Armoire</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Armoire</span></figure><span class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Unlimited plan is pricey<br></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-it-made-the-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It Made the List</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Armoire combines rental and styling services, which is perfect for people who want to spruce up their office looks.

With Rocksbox rentals, enjoy sets of three designer jewelry pieces at a time, including your picks of earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and rings. You can exchange your sets and keep shipments for as long as you'd like with an active subscription ($21/month). Moreover, the $21 fee can go toward purchasing jewelry in your sets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, bear in mind that Rocksbox is mostly for plated designer jewelry or demi-fine jewelry, so you won't have access to fine jewelry. Still, you can choose from many styles, whether you're into tennis bracelets, celestial earrings, or resin rings. The designers featured are fairly reputable, too, including names such as Kate Spade and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kendra Scott</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Base Price: </strong>$21/month | <strong>No. of Items per Box: </strong>3 | <strong>Free Shipping:</strong> Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-full-outfits-urbanebox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Full Outfits: UrbaneBox</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Urbane</span></figure><span class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Sends a full outfit with every delivery<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>Can keep everything with no additional fees</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Can request size exchanges</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-it-made-the-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It Made the List</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">UrbaneBox sends subscribers a hand-selected outfit every month, so you can always count on having two to three pieces with each delivery to upgrade your look. Featuring styles for men and women, the company caters toward a business-casual aesthetic, with picks such as button-ups and boots. With the service, you'll be put in touch with a stylist who will curate a package based on your preferences.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since UrbaneBox isn't a try-then-buy service, you can keep everything in the set without extra fees.

One thing to note is that pausing your subscription will require you to email customer support, as the company lacks a dedicated phone line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Base Price: </strong>$76/month | <strong>No. of Items per Box: </strong>2–3 | <strong>Free Shipping: </strong>$1 handling fee<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-loungewear-sets-ellie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Loungewear Sets: Ellie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ellie</span></figure><span class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Guarantees top and bottom sets every month<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>Choice selection is not overwhelming</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Multiple plans to choose from</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-it-made-the-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It Made the List</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ellie encourages subscribers to select comfy sets, with an emphasis on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>athleisure wear</a>. An Ellie Box subscription starts at $45 per month, and you get a new outfit every month — all you have to do is select your sizes from pre-curated sets. Ellie Box guarantees a top and bottom set each month and presents three collections at a time. If you don't love the selection available, you can always skip a month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With Ellie, you'll find many loungewear sweatshirts, hoodies, and shorts, so the styles aren't strictly geared toward fitness activities. The most basic two-piece plan comes with a top and a bottom, but you can choose a three- or five-piece set for bonus items such as sports bras. Keep in mind that Ellie features a limited XS to XXL size range and only offers women's styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Base Price: </strong>$45/month | <strong>No. of Items per Box:</strong> 2–5 | <strong>Free Shipping: </strong>Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-lingerie-adore-me></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Lingerie: Adore Me</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Adore Me</span></figure><span class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Each set contains four to seven pieces<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>Specific service for lingerie and underwear</p></li><li readability=0><p>Decent size range, including XS to 4X</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-it-made-the-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It Made the List</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you're into a flirty vibe or a sexy one, enjoy gorgeous lingerie with an Elite Box from Adore Me. Each box includes four to seven styles, featuring picks for lingerie, bras, panties, and more. When it comes to sizing, Adore Me is relatively size-inclusive, carrying band sizes 30 to 46, cups A to I, and sizes XS to 4X. One thing to consider is that the pieces do lean intricate and lacy, so Adore Me may not be for those who prefer simple styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like many try-then-buy services, Adore Me charges a $20 styling fee, crediting the money toward items you keep after your seven-day try-on period. With underwear involved, you might have concerns about how the company keeps everything sanitary with returns. However, Adore Me has a multi-point inspection system at its logistics center to handle returns. Plus, products have features that make it easy to see if they've been tampered with, such as plastic liners on panties.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Base Price: </strong>$20 styling fee | <strong>No. of Items per Box: </strong>4–7 | <strong>Free Shipping:</strong> Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-casual-wear-menlo-club></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Casual Wear: Menlo Club</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Menlo</span></figure><span class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Includes versatile basic pieces such as joggers and sneakers<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>Can choose monthly or quarterly plans</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Membership perks such as exclusive discounts</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-it-made-the-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It Made the List</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Menlo Club is a go-to option if you have your eyes peeled for casual clothing like joggers, fleeces, sneakers, and henleys for stylish but low-key outfits. While you won't find formal attire with Menlo Club, it's still worth checking out for the simple pieces you'll likely wear on a day-to-day basis.

With a Stance subscription, you can make sure you always have a pair on hand. The company's sock plans start at two pairs per month for $18, and you can customize your preferred delivery cadence and how many socks you get in each shipment. The available size range is relatively inclusive, as you can select anywhere from a men's size 3 (or women's size 5) to a men's 17.

Subscriptions feature preselected sets with free subscription deliveries. On the other hand, memberships take things up a notch by giving you sock selection choices, free delivery on all shipments (including non-subscription ones), and a 10 percent discount on all non-subscription purchases.

One logistical matter to consider is that the size range available is limited from newborns to 12-year-olds, so this service isn't the best for teens.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-151 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Base Price: </strong>$20 styling fee | <strong>No. of Items per Box: </strong>4–8 | <strong>Free Shipping:</strong> Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-everyday-kids-style-kidpik></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-152 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Everyday Kids' Style: Kidpik</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-153 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kidpik</span></figure><span class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Clothes are casual enough for children's everyday wear<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>Only pay for what you keep</p></li><li readability=1><p>No membership, styling, or shipping fees</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-it-made-the-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-156 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It Made the List</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-157 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kidpik curates everyday clothes (think tees and jeans) for your little one in its try-then-buy boxes. Each set comes with seven pieces, and your child has seven days to try everything. There are no membership, styling, or shipping fees, so you won't need to worry about hidden costs. Plus, the items, all designed by Kidpik itself, have an average of about $16 each, so the service is relatively inexpensive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-158 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kidpik's selection will fit a wide range of kids, as it includes everything from sizes 12M to 16. While you can update the style and fit preferences, bear in mind that a stylist will do all the shopping for you. You do have control over your delivery frequency, however, which you can adjust to four-, six-, or 12-week cadences.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-159 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Base Price: </strong>Varies depending on what you select | <strong>No. of Items per Box: </strong>7 | <strong>Free Shipping: </strong>Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-final-thoughts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Final Thoughts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're simply looking to try then buy and enjoy a styling service such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="subid1=${DOC_ID}&subid2=${REQUEST_ID}">Stitch Fix</a> — you can also specifically try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow">Dia & Co</a> for plus-size fits and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow">Collective Child</a> for elegant kids' clothes.

Clothing subscription services may rent out clothes, allow you to try then buy clothes, or simply send yours-to-keep pieces. Often, you'll fill out a style quiz to help the company and its stylists gauge your preferences so they can send items based on your size and taste. Alternatively, you may be able to specifically request or choose pieces.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do clothing subscriptions save you money?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clothing subscriptions can be pricey, but they can help you save money in the long run. For example, if you choose a rental service, you can wear clothes without paying full prices for luxury pieces or dealing with dry cleaning costs. But even if you go with a subscription where you actually buy the clothes, you can save some money as many try-then-buy services' styling fees will go toward your final purchase — you may even get a discount if you buy an entire box.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are the clothes in clothing subscription boxes high quality?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many clothing subscriptions offer pieces from trusted brands. For example, you may find items from well-regarded designers such as Paco Rabanne from rental services such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="sid=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">Rent the Runway</a>. For try-then-buy clothing boxes, the clothes you receive are often limited to your budget preferences. While price doesn't always correlate with quality, this is worth considering when you set your clothing subscription budget.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do you get to keep the clothes in a clothing subscription box?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether or not you get to keep the clothes in a clothing subscription box depends on your subscription type. Some clothing subscriptions work in a fairly straightforward manner where everything in your shipment is yours to keep. For clothing rental services, you can typically keep your pieces with an active membership, although some companies also offer the option to buy rentals. There are also try-then-buy services in which you only keep items you want.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best clothing rental service?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There is a wide range of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clothing rental services</a> available online, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow">Gwynnie Bee</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow">Le Tote</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Nuuly</a>.

Additionally, any services that carry a wide range of sizes, offer purchasing discounts, and feature a large selection of brands were given extra points in the scoring phase. Companies with a limited delivery scope did not make it past the initial research stage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5aWwKm1zqdmm52jqXqkuM6tn6Kml2LAtq7SnKmiqKSevK95waivnqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
