I'm sure she was good to some.

But sometimes I get egged on when people ask me questions and I just blurt out the first thing that comes to my mind. It's not like I plan on it, I just can't help myself."</p><p>In a recent interview with host Aaron Smith-Levin about growing up in <span id=99c8b831-7718-48c4-a9f5-e769191811a3 class=suggested-link><a href=#>Scientology</a></span> he also got deeper into his thoughts on his sister and blamed the breakdown of their relationship on her drinking.</p><p>He also said she hated him <span id=6583d218-04cd-43d5-9611-0af1a0408519 class=suggested-link>smoking</span> weed from a young age as she was "anti-drugs" for many years until she battled with addiction later in life, which she was open about.</p><p>"The problem with my sister and I is that she would drink, and she had five security people with her everywhere she went," Navarone said.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR'</h2><p>"So I would just try and go and do my own thing. I'm not a huge drinker .. I prefer smoking pot.&nbsp;</p><p>"We would go to New York or whatever, [and] I would leave the vicinity and go to Central Park. I would go somewhere in the middle of nowhere and just smoke a quick joint and go back to the hotel.&nbsp;</p><p>"By the time I get back to the hotel the phone is ringing, ‘Were you just smoking pot in Central Park?’ How the f*** did you know that? ‘Well, I had my security guard follow you. I'm calling mom right now.’</p><p>"Then I'd get a call from mom, ‘Were you just smoking pot in Central Park?'</p><p>"Then she [Lisa Marie] would drink and she'd kind of look around the room and say, ‘Errrr, you’ .. then she'd decide to go off and tell you everything that's wrong with you and your life.</p><p>"It was pretty destructful [destructive]. I never got angry like that, I never said anything I didn't mean when I smoked pot, but she would say really awful things to me that kind of kept us from being close when she would drink."</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, the host said he didn't have the privilege of knowing Lisa Marie, to which her brother laughed: "That's not a privilege… sorry, sorry."</p><p>He admitted he didn't go to the <span id=2be5011f-6def-4edc-9984-22e9fcfcf0d2 class=suggested-link>family</span> and friends part of the star's funeral when she was <a href=#>buried at Graceland</a>, saying even if his mom had invited him he wouldn't she "knew I wouldn't have gone."</p><p>Navarone went on to say he was also not close with Lisa's son <a href=#>Benjamin Keough</a>, who fatally shot himself at his family home in July 2020 aged just 27.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>RILEY PRAISE</h2><p>Lisa left behind three other children; <a href=#>Riley Keough</a>, 34, with ex Danny, along with 15-year-old twins Harper and Finley with former husband Michael Lockwood.</p><p>"I don’t know where Riley came from because she's an angel that came from somewhere that had none of the narcissism, none of the antagonism [in the family]," he said.</p><p>"She's literally like the sweetest, kindest, most amazing human in the world. I love Riley out of my whole family.</p><p>"She's pretty much the only one on my mom's side I actually care about. And the twins too! But they still gotta grow."</p><p>The family has settled disagreements over Lisa Marie's estate, and Riley, 34, became the sole trustee, with Navarone granted a ninth of his half-sister's estate.</p><p>Despite their rocky relationship over the years, Priscilla, 78, was left devastated by Lisa Marie's death and opened up about her loss to The Sun's <a href=#>Piers Morgan</a> on <span id=1f6236be-b01a-46af-a82f-f02dfa6e85be class=suggested-link>TalkTV</span>.</p><p>She said she was suffering from severe abdominal pain after going to the Chateau Marmont for a drink together after celebrating the Elvis movie at the Golden Globes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17>"We went and sat down, and she said, 'Mom, I have to go, my stomach really hurts.' I go, 'Of course, are you OK?' She goes, 'Yes, yes, I just really have to go'.
