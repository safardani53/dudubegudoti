Some of you may know that we have four children,” the “Tennessee Whiskey” singer, 40, told the audience at Madison Square Garden in NYC on Friday, according to <a href=#>a video posted by The Blast</a>. “We just had twins, about seven months ago. Now there’s four of us, but we’re gonna make it five!”</p><p>Morgane, who was onstage with her husband, smiled happily at her husband after his speech.</p><p>As previously reported, the couple <a href=#>welcomed their twin boys in March</a> and the singer was unable to attend the Academy of Country Music Awards to accept his Album of the Year award the following month because of the babies’ early arrival.</p><p>“Chris couldn’t be here cause Morgane’s expecting twins,” the show’s host, <a href=#><strong>Reba McEntire</strong></a>, said as she accepted Stapleton’s award in his absence. “We just found out that those little rascals came a little bit early. Hot off the press! Twin boys.”</p><p>The couple, who recently celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary, are also parents of a girl, 8, and boy, 6.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The private pair, who haven’t publicly announced their kids’ names, <a href=#>shared a photo of their twins</a> in a post on Morgane’s Instagram account in April that showed the mom cradling her newborn babies.</p><p>“We’re so grateful to finally be home with our sweet family,” she wrote on April 18. “We would like to say a special thank you to all the incredible nurses & doctors at Centennial Women’s & Children’s Hospital in Nashville. At more than a month early, we had a week long stay in the nicu & the incredible people there kept our boys healthy & happy. Words cannot express our gratitude for you all & what you did for our family. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewG6%2F05qnpZ2kpLu0edainZ5lnaS%2FqK3NnmSpqpWcu6K602auoqyYYrOqstOhZJygmaGxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
