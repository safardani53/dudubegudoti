With my family, we just skipped episode 6. It was a no-go!”</p><p>The first season followed Daphne as she navigated the ballrooms of 1813 London with her siblings Eloise (<strong><a href=#>Claudia Jessie</a></strong>), Anthony (<a href=#><strong>Jonathan Bailey</strong></a>), Colin (<a href=#><strong>Luke Newton</strong></a>) and Benedict (<strong>Luke Thompson</strong>). While attempting to fend off overzealous suitors, she struck up a friendship with Simon, the Duke of Hastings (<a href=#><strong>Regé-Jean Page</strong></a>), with whom she eventually fell in love.</p><p>Over the course of Daphne and Simon’s relationship, things got very, very steamy — and that’s without even taking into account the other sex scenes featuring Anthony and his lover, Siena (<strong>Sabrina Bartlett</strong>), and Benedict’s various exploits.</p><p>“I had to sort of sit by the remote and fast forward the bits before episode 6 that are slightly on the precarious side as well,” Dynevor continued on Conan. “I’m like, ‘You don’t need to see this bit!'”</p><p>When Page hosted <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> in February, <a href=#>he and the cast poked fun</a> at those “bits” in a sketch where two inexperienced crew members have to substitute for the intimacy coordinator while she was out.</p><p>However, <strong>Lizzy Talbot</strong>, the show’s real-life intimacy coordinator, has said that filming <a href=#>the series’ steamiest moments</a> is much less sexy than a viewer might assume. “It’s not very glamorous at all,” she told <a href=#>CNN</a> in January.</p><p>For his part, creator and showrunner <strong>Chris Van Dusen</strong> has acknowledged the complex choreography involved in each of those scenes, but noted that the writers try to ensure that every instance of sex or nudity has a purpose beyond titillation.</p><p>“We do have a lot of sex on the show, but nothing is gratuitous,” he told <a href=#>Esquire</a> in January. “There’s no scene where we’re having our characters have sex just to be having sex. We’re always pushing the narrative forward and telling a story through these scenes.”</p><p><a href=#>Season 2 has only just started filming</a>, but if <strong>Julia Quinn’s</strong> source material is anything to go by, there will be plenty more blush-inspiring moments. Van Dusen told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> that the new episodes will showcase “peak thirst,” even though <a href=#>Page will not return as Simon</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re inspired by really delicious romance novels,” Van Dusen said in January. “And the sensuality [and] sexuality was always something that we were excited to be able to lean into on the show.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to read more of the Bridgerton cast’s thoughts on the show’s steamiest moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXv6qwxp6praeeYrCiv9Nmm6Krk6rAtHnToZxmq5ikxLR5zJqlsmWjmsVuv8KepZ6rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
