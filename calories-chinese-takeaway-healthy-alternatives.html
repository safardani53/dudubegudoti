a large pancake is worth around 193 calories.</p><p>And a large egg fried rice - a staple to many takeaways - is 850 calories alone.</p><p>Emma, Nutracheck senior nutritionist and fitness expert, said that as well as the oil and fat, salt and sugar are relied on heavily for Chinese takeout.</p><p>"I’m sure many of us have woken up with a raging thirst in the middle of the night after a Chinese takeaway," she said.</p><p>"And just half a container of sweet and sour chicken can contain the maximum daily allowance of added sugar."</p><h2><strong>How can you eat healthy from the Chinese takeaway?</strong></h2><p>Emma said "it’s possible to eat anything you like when losing weight" if you monitor the quantity and frequency of it.</p><p>"Cutting out everything you love is a surefire way to feel deprived and risk giving up much sooner," she said.</p><p>"If you fancy a Chinese takeaway, go for it, just factor it in to your intake across the week and make some allowances elsewhere to save on calories.</p><p>"And ensure it is an occasional meal, not a regular dinner.</p><p>"Rather than having half a container of noodles and three deep fried chicken balls for example, opt for a quarter of a container of noodles and just one or two chicken balls.</p><p>"Take your time while eating and trust me, you’ll realise you don’t need the portions you thought you did."</p><p>When picking what to order, Emma says avoid "large quantities are deep fried foods and those in rich, fatty sauces".</p><p>"Examples are deep fried chicken balls, sesame prawn toast, wontons, beef curry," she said.</p><p>"Sweet and sour dishes are also likely to be high in sugar and calories, so try to steer clear of these.</p><p>"Instead, opt for the dry noodle dishes which are heavy on beansprouts and vegetables, and meat options like chicken satay sticks which are not coated in rich sauces."</p><p>Emma said chicken chow mein and black bean sauce dishes aren't the worst options in terms of calories.</p><p>The problem is eating large quantities - and most people overeat Chinese takeaway.</p><p>Emma said: "Avoid double, or even triple, carbing – so if you’re having noodles, don’t add rice and chips as well.</p><p>"Choose one carb (rice or chips or noodles), with vegetables and low fat protein such as chicken or prawns.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"Also, choose plain rice over egg fried rice."</p><p>Kim suggested having steamed dumplings, grilled fish, stir fried vegetables or a broth soup.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How many calories are in your favourite Chinese takeaway dish?</h3></p><ul><li>Beef in black bean sauce: 540 calories in a typical plastic container</li><li>Chicken chow mein: 820 calories in a large foil container&nbsp;</li><li>Egg fried rice: 850 calories in a large typical plastic container (457g)</li><li>Crispy duck pancakes: 103 calories in a small pancake, and 193 in a large pancake</li><li>Sweet and sour chicken: 1,015 calories in a typical plastic container&nbsp;</li><li>Chicken in cashew nuts: 384 calories in half a typical plastic container</li><li>King prawns and mixed vegetables: 436 calories in a typical plastic container</li><li>Sweet and sour chicken ball: 70 calories per ball</li><li>Prawn toast: 230 calories per two toasts</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzf5NqaW9rY2SworjOq6Ceq12Ytaq6xKycZqyRoLKiw8CyZKGdkaHBqcWMmqOtnaKjrrW11Z6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD -
