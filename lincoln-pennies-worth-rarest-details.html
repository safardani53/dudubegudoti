1909, the Indian head was the design of the&nbsp;<a href=#>penny</a>, which was produced by the Mint in 1958.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

href=#>wheat ears</a>&nbsp;design on the reverse.</p><p>Other designs in the series include the&nbsp;<a href=#>Memorial cent</a>, union shield, and the Bicentennial.</p><p>But regardless, your Lincoln penny, like other&nbsp;<a href=#>coins</a>,&nbsp;could be quite valuable and you may not even know it.</p><p>This includes low mintage,&nbsp;<a href=#>errors</a>,&nbsp;or key dates.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON COINS ">READ MORE ON COINS</h2><p>Also, grade and condition are something to keep in mind, as grading services that certify coins give it a score between one and 70, with the highest being flawless.</p><p>Grades 60 or above means it’s in Mint State (MS) or Proof (P), which are seen more as collectors’ items rather than general circulation.</p><p>Below, we list some of the most valuable Lincoln pennies that have sold in recent auctions.</p><p>This includes P, MS, and coins in circulation.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/JF-US-THE-MOST-VALUABLE-COINS-ROUND-UP-COMP-01.jpg><p>You might be familiar with a&nbsp;<a href=#>double die error</a>, which is when specific numbers and letters are duplicated.</p><p>But what some may not have known is that this can make a particular penny worth more than $1million.</p><p>Well, this happened to be a coin from Stewart Blay’s collection, who consigned them to auction house Irvine,&nbsp;<a href=#>California</a>-based GreatCollections.</p><p>Most of his coins were worth only just under $3 but he had a 1958 double die penny, which featured duplicates of "In God we trust" and the word "Liberty.”</p><p>In addition, it was certified in an “MS65RD” grade by Professional Coin Grading Service.</p><p>That coin, which&nbsp;<a href=#>sold</a>&nbsp;for around $1.14million, set the auction record double die coins.</p><h2><strong>2. 1969 DOUBLE DIE PENNY – $553,000</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/JF-US-THE-MOST-VALUABLE-COINS-ROUND-UP-COMP-02.jpg><p>You may want to look out for double die pennies because another one from 1969&nbsp;<a href=#>sold</a>&nbsp;for a total of $535,000 (before fees) through GreatCollections.</p><p>It also has an S mintmark, which stands for San Francisco.</p><p>This is important because the reported mintage is just 15, according to&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">PCGS</a>.</p><p>While the 1969-S piece will likely be valuable either way, how much it’s worth could depend on the grade.</p><p>For example, sold auctions revealed by PCGS show that the double die variety can sell for anywhere between $16,500 and $126,500.</p><p>But the one that sold in the GreatCollection auction was certified in a higher grade of MS 66.</p><p>It was also labeled as an RD piece, which means it still maintains at least 85 percent of its original red luster just like the 1958 double die penny explained above.</p><h2><strong>3. 1909 VDB PENNY – $366,600</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/JF-US-THE-MOST-VALUABLE-COINS-ROUND-UP-COMP-03.jpg><p>The 1909 VDB penny has an interesting story behind it.</p><p>The initials stand for designer Victor David Brenner – but they did not make an appearance on a Lincoln penny after that year.</p><p>This is because they caused controversy over both the placement and size of the initials.</p><p>While circulated Lincoln VDB pennies could be valuable as it is, a particular example takes it to another level.</p><p>One that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a>&nbsp;for $366,000 was certified in a P67+RD grade by PCGS.</p><p>Ian Russell, president of GreatCollections, called it the “king of Lincoln proof cents."</p><h2><strong>4. 1922 LINCOLN PENNY – $1,900</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/JF-US-THE-MOST-VALUABLE-COINS-ROUND-UP-COMP-04.jpg><p>And there’s a penny out there that’s a little more common for coin fans to find.</p><p>That’s the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1922 Lincoln penny</a>&nbsp;without a mint mark, which could be valuable in even circulated grades.</p><p>This is because pennies that year were only struck at the Denver Mint.</p><p>And while there were more than 7.1million of those coins minted with a D mark, not all of them featured it due to a mistake made in the production process.</p><p>Of the no D mark coins, 25,000 are estimated to have been minted with “perhaps” 10,000 pieces surviving, according to collector’s guide&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Lincoln Cents</a>.</p><p>That variety of the 1922 penny is worth $970 in average condition, according to&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">USA Coin Book</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>One example on eBay recently&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">sold</a>&nbsp;online for a total of $1,893 after 66 bids.&nbsp;</p><p>The seller labeled the coin grade as “AU++,” which stands for about uncirculated.&nbsp;</p><h2
