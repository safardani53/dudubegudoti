A friend had secretly entered her into a comedy contest, which she won, earning her the title, "Funniest Person on Campus." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The abrasive diva&nbsp;caught people's attention after her successful run as a complementary act on Katt Williams' "It's Pimpin' Pimpin'" tour.&nbsp;</p><p>Standing at 6-ft tall with big eyes and a round, rubbery face, she knew she did not look&nbsp;standard Hollywood, but she used her unique features to make people laugh. It's not uncommon for comedians to refer to their looks, and Jones did it with confidence.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But it wasn't always like that.

When she saw the lady, she felt like she would not care what anyone said about her if she looked anything like her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As for her above-average height, she shared that she never had a problem until she became interested in boys.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“I never had a problem with it until I discovered boys. Then I became aware of it. It took me a while, but I’m totally into it now. I wear 6-in. heels.</p><p>Jones eventually learned to use her height to her advantage by playing basketball.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After playing basketball in high school, Jones received a basketball scholarship from Chapman University in Orange, California. She then transferred to Colorado State University, where she discovered she had a knack for making people laugh when her friend entered her in a comedy contest.&nbsp;</p><h2>Leslie Jones Makes it Big</h2><p>Jones spent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">most of her career</a> doing stand-up in local clubs like The Comedy Store in Hollywood.&nbsp;Her big break finally arrived when&nbsp;she landed an audition in December 2013 for the late-night comedy show and was offered a writing position.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Less than a year later, Jones got to perform in front of the cameras in a weekend update&nbsp;segment, ranting about her hilarious dating experiences.&nbsp;</p><p>She is famous for saying&nbsp;what's on her mind unabashedly, and while that brings her peace now, it was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born from tragedy</a>. In 2015, she made a post on Twitter in tribute to her late brother, advising people to love their siblings while they can.&nbsp;</p><p>My brother died, and I can’t explain how many realisms come to you when someone close to you dies and how much stuff you don’t care about anymore.</p><p>The new attitude spearheaded <a href=# rel=follow>her comedy career</a>. She was eventually recognized as one of "The 100 Most Influential People" by&nbsp;Time&nbsp;magazine in 2017.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It's safe to say that Jones has&nbsp;made it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSVqLmqsYyjpqedo2K9or7Ep6usZaOer621zaCqZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
