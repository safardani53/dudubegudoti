But, their&nbsp;demand has remained unanswered to&nbsp;date.&nbsp;</p><p>There were some&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speculations</a> that the new season would air by the end of 2017, while the others claimed that the production process would be completed by 2018. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It's&nbsp;2021, and the fans are yet to get a fresh season.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Chivalry-of-a-Failed-Knight-poster_1.jpg></p><p>However, the viewers now have a reason to be happy as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official websites </a>confirmed that a "special" was on its way. This was the only thing that affirmed&nbsp;the&nbsp;audience's faith on the possibility of a second season.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>While the exact release date has not been revealed yet, Chivalry of a Failed Knight&nbsp;Special&nbsp;is expected to release sometime in 2021 or early 2022. Whether the special is a whole new season or just an Original Video Animation (OVA) remains to be unknown.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>According to the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> reports</a> from&nbsp;Anime Next Season, there are a few reasons that might have halted the second season of the anime. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The in-depth research for the aforementioned report&nbsp;was carried out in three parts, namely,&nbsp;Source Material Information, Sales and Profit Information, and Popularity information.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>It was&nbsp;reported that there was enough source material&nbsp;for creating the content of at least five more seasons of fantasy anime. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the research revealed that the anime didn't do well in material sales, merch sales, and blu-ray. This indicated that the producers gained no profit or even faced a slight loss with the first adaptation, which resulted in the delay or even a cancellation of a second season.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Chivalry-of-a-Failed-Knight-characters.jpeg></p><p>Even though people liked the first season for its storyline,&nbsp;it was reported that the popularity of the anime series&nbsp;in terms of quantifiable metrics&nbsp;was pretty low. As per reports, social media promotion and merchandise have been abandoned since two years ago.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Based on the Japanese novel&nbsp;written by Riku Misora and illustrated by Won, the anime had twelve episodes in total and was a balanced mixture of three major genres at onceâ€”action, erotic romance, and fantasy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i1qsLApamyZZ%2BbeqJ5xZqgpZ2UYrivtcahq2arlZbAsLqMa2SrnZyarrSxjJ2YrZ1encGuuA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
