Holmes</b> were fan-favorites on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Good Morning America</i></a>. The former co-anchors shared enjoyable on-air banter for years, and they eventually <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>started dating.</a> So, are they still together after separating from their respective spouses?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Scroll down to find out Amy and T.J.’s current relationship status.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Are Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes Still Together?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Amy and T.J. are still together today. The two even went Instagram official in October 2023. Amy posted a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of two reserved seats for her and T.J, adding the hashtag “#truelove” to her caption. Over the summer, the couple were photographed working out together in New York City. Prior to that, they were spotted around Manhattan multiple times throughout the year.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>T.J. also finalized his divorce from ex-wife <b>Marilee Fiebig </b>in October, nearly one year after he and Amy’s romance became public knowledge. For Amy’s part, she finalized her divorce from ex-husband<b> Andrew Shue</b> in March.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Amy and her ex-husband were reportedly separated by the time her relationship with T.J. surfaced in November 2022. That month, she and T.J. were seen getting cozy while out on the town. Less than a month later, they were taken off of <i>GMA3</i>. For his part, though, T.J.’s now-ex-wife was reportedly shocked about his romance with Amy, which ignited rumors that T.J. cheated on Marilee.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Shortly after T.J. filed for divorce from Marilee in December 2022, her lawyer told<i> Entertainment Tonight </i>that they were “disappointed by T.J’s lack of discretion, respect and sensitivity toward Marilee and the party’s daughter.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Why Were Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes Fired From ‘GMA’?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>In early 2023, the television personalities were removed from <i>GMA3</i>. “After several productive conversations with Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes, about different options, we all agreed it’s best for everyone that they move on from ABC News,” a spokesperson said from ABC, the company that oversees <i>GMA</i>. “We recognize their talent and commitment over the years and are thankful for their contributions.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Though the studio did not publicly address their relationship, multiple outlets reported that the reason for their <i>GMA</i> departure was their romance. One month before the pair was ousted from their show, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> unveiled a conversation in an editorial call that network president<b> Kim Godwin</b> made to the staff in 2022.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“I want to say that while [Amy and T.J.’s] relationship is not a violation of company policy, I really have taken the last few days to think about and work through what I think is best for the ABC News organization,” Kim said, per the outlet. “These decisions are not easy, they are not knee-jerk, but they are necessary for the brand and for our priority which, you guys know, are all of us — the people here at ABC.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CrnGaZna56s7vBmpqhZZGjsW7AjKNkoaecorK0edKtoKWkXam8qLHToZyrZZGbwaa%2BjK2fnqGiYrSurYyanZ%2BZmad6dn2WbWlwaV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
