It can be used when ordering through the app or in person at stores.</p><p>Secondly, the deal is only valid from noon to 6 and expires on December 8.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more on starbucks">read more on starbucks</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>DRINK UP</h2><p>Customers can take advantage of the coupon to try one of the new drinks from Starbucks's <a href=#>holiday menu</a>.</p><p>The holiday beverages include the new Iced Gingerbread Oatmilk Chai, and fan-favorites like Peppermint Mocha, Caramel Brulée Latte, Chestnut Praline Latte, and Iced Sugar Cookie Almondmilk Latte.</p><p>Plus, four new cold foam flavors are sure to put you in the spirit of the season:</p><ul><li>Peppermint Chocolate Cream: A mix of peppermint-flavored syrup and chocolate malt</li><li>Sugar Cookie Cream: Sugar cookie-flavored syrup</li><li>Chestnut Praline Cream: A blend of caramelized chestnut and spices</li><li>Caramel Brulée Cream: Rich caramel brulée sauce</li></ul><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>All of the cold foam options are blended with the chain's signature vanilla sweet cream.</p><p>Some drinks are already topped with the foam, but it costs an additional $1.25 to add it to other drinks regardless of the size.</p><p>Starbucks didn't forget about those with a sweet tooth either as it added a few seasonal pastries and treats including the Cranberry Bliss Bar, Gingerbread Loaf, Peppermint Brownie Cake Pop, Snowman Cookie, and Sugar Plum&nbsp;Cheese&nbsp;Danish.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HOW TO SCORE FREE COFFEE</h2><p>For the tenth year ina row, the coffee shop brought back its <a href=#>Starbucks for Life</a> game.</p><p>There is no purchase necessary to enter, and several prizes are available including stars that can be used to redeem free items.</p><p>But this year, some <a href=#>X</a>&nbsp;users have taken to&nbsp;<a href=#>social media</a>&nbsp;to point out a few flaws in the game.</p><p>One user wrote: "Starbucks whats the deal with the Starbucks for life game? Why is no one getting any plays? It doesn't say anywhere on the rules you have to purchase items to get plays."</p><p>Another similar complaint reads: "Why do I have zero plays on Starbucks for Life today? I thought they refreshed daily?"</p><p>Starbucks addressed the complaints saying, "Each Entrant will receive one Game play for registering for the Promotion (first visit only)."</p><p>This is different than in previous years when players were given one free try each day.</p><p>"So they’re not doing one free shake every day like they did last year? This is BS," wrote one frustrated player.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Customers were "devastated" to hear that a holiday favorite <a href=#>wouldn't be returning</a>.</p><p>Plus, a Starbucks employee explained <a href=#>how to get free drinks</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfboVxhJJrbmirpJa%2Fo8HCpKpmoJGhs2680aKanmWUp7avt9JmmqitoKS7bq3PqWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
