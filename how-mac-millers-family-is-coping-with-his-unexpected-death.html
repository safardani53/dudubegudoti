They’re leaning on one another to cope with this devastating and unexpected loss. The family is very appreciative for all of the love and support they’ve received.”</p><p>Miller (real name Malcolm McCormick) was <a href=#>found dead from a suspected drug overdose</a> at his home in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles on Friday, September 7. His relatives <a href=#>remembered him in a statement</a> released later that day as “a bright light in this world for his family, friends and fans.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mac-Miller-family-coping.jpg><p>Hundreds of people mourned the “Dang!” rapper during a <a href=#>public vigil at Blue Slide Park</a> in his hometown of Pittsburgh on Tuesday, September 11. He had named his 2011 debut album after the playground.</p><p>Miller’s ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>, whom he dated from August 2016 until this May, was among the many friends, collaborators and celebrities who <a href=#>took to social media after his death</a>. The “God Is a Woman” singer, 25, posted a <a href=#>captionless black-and-white picture</a> of him on Instagram on Saturday, September 8.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Ariana is <a href=#>absolutely heartbroken</a>,” a source later told Us exclusively. “Her entire family is in shock too. They all grew close to Mac during his relationship with Ari. He was a huge part of her life, and they always shared such a special bond. She wanted nothing but positivity in Mac’s life after they broke up.”</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, contact the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline</a> at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6diuqKvjKagpaSVp8BussCmoKWxXZ7Abq%2FOqaCnn12strW0jKGgrGWlo7K5vMScq56cXZmyosDHaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
