From the time Sister Rosetta Tharpe slung an electric guitar around her shoulders and played the soulful R&B that would birth the sound of rock and roll, the guitar has been a conduit of creativity and excitement. As the decades continued, the instrument became iconic. The country and western genre evolved into the sound that would see Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves, and Brandi Carlile crossover into the pop world.</p><p>Even pop stars want to be rock stars. Harry Styles knows his way around a guitar, as do H.E.R., John Mayer, and more. Plus, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is built upon the works of Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, B.B. King, and Prince, all of who made those guitars sing like never before.</p><p>Learning the guitar is easier than ever. <a href=#>Fender Play</a>, Fenderâ€™s subscription-based learning app for guitar, bass, and ukulele, makes it easy to learn the fundamentals and progress beyond the beginner stage. Plus, learning the guitar can help out students.</p><p>According to information provided by the <a href=#>Fender Play Foundation</a>, the 501(c)(3) public charity organization dedicated to increasing access to music education, arts and music access in schools (Prescool-grade 12) is linked to improved outcomes. Students with music and art classes have a 5x lower dropout rate, are twice as likely to graduate, show increased mental well-being, and increased cognitive development, and are more inclined to pursue a career. So, along with the joy that comes with playing the guitar, the music lessons at school will lead to a better life.
