The children also spend time with Klum's current husband, musician <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Tom Kaulitz</a>, who considers himself <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>an "extra dad"</a> to the four kids.

Leni's biological father is Italian businessman Flavio Briatore — although his and Klum's relationship ended while she was still pregnant. Klum began dating Seal not long after and the couple married in 2005. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Seal officially adopted Leni</a> in 2009 when she was 5 years old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before she was even born, Leni had a moment in the spotlight. In an Instagram post for Leni's 17th birthday, Klum revealed that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she was four months pregnant</a> with her daughter when she walked in the 2003 Victoria's Secret runway show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am not alone walking down that catwalk here," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Klum captioned a video</a> from the show. "If I look close enough then I can see you bumping right along at 4 months @LeniKlum. I loved you before you were born, and I will love you long after I close my eyes forever."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days, 19-year-old Leni is a model herself, which is something Klum made her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wait until she was 16</a> to pursue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an exclusive interview with PEOPLE, Leni shared that Klum <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wouldn't let her model for Brandy Melville</a> when she was 12.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was really sad about it, but in the end she was right. And I feel like that's what sparked me to want to model more," she said. Years later, Leni booked her first modeling gig posing for the cover of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue Germany</a> with her mother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She has since participated in many other shoots and has graced the covers of Rollacoaster magazine, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Harper's Bazaar Germany</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Glamour Germany</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the fashion world can certainly be difficult for a young adult to navigate, Leni has her mom right by her side to advise and guide her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I said to her, at the end of the day you have to be happy with yourself," Klum <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE</a> of the advice she gave her daughter. "And don't do anything you don't want to do. It's okay to say no. You don't always have to please people. But I'm always with Leni. And she has a very good head on her shoulders."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jacopo M.

In October 2021, she and Seal attended the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>premiere of Netflix's The Harder They Fall</a> together, and in June 2022, Leni and Klum were photographed at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>premiere of Jurassic World: Dominion</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In another sweet moment, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Leni wore one of Klum's dresses</a> from the '90s to her high school prom in May 2022. She captioned an Instagram post of herself, "Prom night in mamas dress 🖤."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Leni graduated from high school, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Klum revealed that her firstborn</a> will be moving to N.Y.C to attend college.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The supermodel announced the news on the Today show and couldn't be more proud of her daughter. "She's moving to the Big Apple. It's kind of my first stomping grounds, so I feel like she's doing it all over again. I'm so proud of her!" she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the school year drew closer, Klum opened up about Leni <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>starting college</a> in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. "I am [so proud]," Klum said. "You know, she has her head screwed on right."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Right now, college is on top of the list. It's not modeling and she's really excited for that next chapter in her life," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Klum also stated that college means Leni is "unfortunately" moving out but that her daughter knows N.Y.C., "inside and out."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That doesn't mean Klum isn't worrying about Leni back home in L.A.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chatting with James Corden</a> on The Late Late Show, Klum confessed that she was calling her daughter "every two hours."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She just moved in, and I call her. Normally she picks up, but then three, four hours I don't hear anything. And already, my head is going 'Where is she? What is she doing? Why is she not answering?' Already the worrying is starting," Klum told Corden.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former Victoria's Secret model then joked about going to extreme measures if she couldn't get ahold of Leni.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want the number of the roommate, so I can bug the roommate if she doesn't pick up," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, it seems Leni is doing just fine on her own. On March 4, 2023, Klum <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>praised her eldest</a> for balancing her interior design studies while also pursuing a modeling career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm very proud of my daughter and her modeling," the proud mom said. "And she's studying at the same time, she's juggling already."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2022, Leni attended her mom's famous <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Halloween party</a> for the first time. The model dressed as Catwoman, complete with a mask and latex suit. "My kids have never really gone to the Halloween party, obviously, because they're all too young," Klum told PEOPLE. "And now my daughter moved to Manhattan, so she was here. It's her first time coming and she was so excited. She's only ever heard about the stories and seen photos. It's fun for her to be here tonight and it's fun for me to have her here!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Nov. 12, 2022, Leni marked her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>3-year anniversary</a> with boyfriend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Aris Rachevsky</a> by sharing a photo of the two posing in green wigs.

Not long after she gave birth, Klum spoke to PEOPLE <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>about the newest addition</a> to her family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everyone who sees him says, 'Oh my god, he looks just like Seal.' And I'm like, 'He has nothing of me? C'mon, there must be something of me in there somewhere.' And they're like, 'No, sorry, he looks just like his father,' " she said of baby Henry at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few years later, in 2008, Klum revealed that her kids had a giant costume closet and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>loved to play dress-up</a>. She also shared that then-3-year-old Henry was comfortable experimenting with all the costumes, including his sister's princess dresses. "There's nothing wrong with that," Klum said at the time, admitting that she also thinks the elegant dresses are "more fun than Buzz Lightyear."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The proud mom <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spoke about Henry's unique fashion sense</a> again in 2011 in an interview with Good Housekeeping. "He lives in his own world," she said. "We went to dinner all dressed properly [and Henry wore dinosaur slippers].

However, the supermodel occasionally posts throwback photos of her younger kids or shots that don't show their entire faces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Henry turned 18, the supermodel posted a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>throwback photo</a> of her giving an infant Henry a bath.

In 2013, his drawings and creativity served as the inspiration behind Klum's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>children's clothing line</a>. "While the other kids are watching a movie, he'll sit down at his desk for 45 minutes and paint monsters one after another," she told Parents magazine of the then-6-year-old.
