Even watching the trailer and seeing a bunch of us up there together was so moving. It’s so special. I feel like for young girls, boys, everything in between, it’s remarkable. There’s a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barbie for everyone</a>, and they really did an incredible job. I remember being on the set and someone’s saying, we don’t have a Barbie in a hijab. The next day you looked up in one of the dream houses and you’re like, ‘There she is.’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>One person who isn’t in the Barbie&nbsp;movie is&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Amy Schumer</a></strong>. Amy was originally attached to the project as the lead star before she dropped out in 2017, and then Greta and <strong>Noah Baumbach</strong> took over writing the screenplay. Amy explained why she quit the film when she appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live</a>&nbsp;on June 8, 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I can’t wait to see the movie. I think it looks awesome. I think we said it was scheduling conflicts,” Amy said to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>. “That’s what we said. But it really was just like, creative differences. But there’s a new team behind it and it looks like it’s very feminist and cool, so I will be seeing this movie.” When Andy asked Amy if the first version of the film “didn’t feel feminist and cool,” she responded, “Yes.”</p><h2>Barbie Release Date</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Margot-Robbies-Barbie-Movie-splash-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>The studio officially announced the release date for the highly anticipated film on April 26, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>via Instagram</a>. In the announcement, Warner Bros. also shared a photo of Margot as the beloved character! They captioned the post with the release date, “#BARBIE July 21, 2023 Only in theaters.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Barbie‘s star even spoke about the project to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>British Vogue</a> way back in June 2021. “Right, it comes with a lot of baggage [playing Barbie]!” Margot said. “And a lot of nostalgic connections. But with that come a lot of exciting ways to attack it. People generally hear ‘Barbie’ and think, ‘I know what that movie is going to be,’ and then they hear that Greta Gerwig is writing and directing it, and they’re like, ‘Oh, well, maybe I don’t.'” Greta directed the 2017 indie film <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lady Bird</a>, as well as the 2019 movie Little Women starring <strong>Saoirse Ronan</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Florence Pugh</strong>, and <strong>Timothée Chalamet</strong>.</p><h2>First Look</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Margot-Robbies-Barbie-Movie-mega-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>The official <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>teaser trailer for Barbie</a> dropped on December 16. Aside from Margot, fans got a glimpse at Ryan as Ken, Issa Rae, Simu Liu, and more. They also got to see Margot wearing the iconic Barbie black and white swimsuit. <span class=s1>The teaser initially played before <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span class=s2><i>Avatar: The Way of Water</i> </span></a>screenings before being released wide.</span></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In addition, Margot and Ryan were spotted out and about <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>during the filming</a> of the movie. A source close to the production team told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that the actress even worked on her birthday. “Margot had to work her birthday week but it was so sweet because she was surprised when the cast and crew got her a giant Barbie cake to celebrate her birthday while working,” the insider told us. Some of the first looks at the character included a hot pink <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cowgirl outfit</a> and Ryan’s black cowboy look. They were even spotted in a 1980s rollerblade look with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hot pink ensembles</a> embracing the iconic doll’s famous color.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Warner Bros. released<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span class=s2>&nbsp;a teaser trailer</span></a> for <i>Barbie</i> on April 3. Margot’s Barbie wears fabulous all-pink outfits and drives the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span class=s2>iconic Barbie pink convertible</span></a> with Ken in the backseat. She also hangs out with other versions of Barbie. The main trailer dropped in May 2023 and has already amassed over 46 million views.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>Plot</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Barbie suffers an existential crisis about her purpose in life in Barbie Land despite having a perfect life. When she begins to have thoughts of death, flat feet, and more, Weird Barbie tells her that she has to go to the real world and find the girl who’s playing with her. Barbie has to fix the rip between Barbie Land and the real world before it’s too late. This sends Barbie on a journey with Ken. In the real world, nothing is as Barbie and Ken expected. However, Barbie does meet Gloria, the woman who’s been playing with her. Barbie wants to take Gloria and her daughter back to Barbie Land to show them how the Barbies are in charge and everything is perfect.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Ken returns to Barbie Land and brings the patriarchy with him. He takes over Barbie Land with the rest of the Kens and turns it into Kendom.&nbsp;After some encouragement from Gloria, Barbie picks herself up and fights to save the other Barbies and Barbie Land. The Barbies succeed in taking down the Kens. However, when the fight is over, Barbie still doesn’t feel like she’s enough. She wants to be in charge of her own destiny, her own ending, so she decides that she wants to be turned into a human. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The movie ends</a> with Barbie returning to the real world with Gloria and Sasha.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>In December 2020, Margot told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, “We like the things that feel a little left of center. Something like Barbie where the IP, the name itself, people immediately have an idea of, ‘Oh, Margot is playing Barbie, I know what that is,’ but our goal is to be like, ‘Whatever you’re thinking, we’re going to give you something totally different — the thing you didn’t know you wanted.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>To prepare for Barbie, Margot told Vogue&nbsp;that Greta told her to listen to an episode of the podcast This American Life&nbsp;about a woman who doesn’t introspect. In that same interview, Margot <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>weighed in on the debate</a> that Barbie is being sexualized for the movie. “I’m like, ‘Okay, she’s a doll. She’s a plastic doll.’ She doesn’t have organs. If she doesn’t have organs, she doesn’t have reproductive organs,” Margot said. “I she doesn’t have reproductive organs, would she even feel sexual desire? No, I don’t think she could. She is sexualized. But she should never be sexy. People can project sex onto her. Yes, she can wear a short skirt, but because it’s fun and pink. Not because she wanted you to see her butt.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>The Wolf of Wall Street star co-produced the film along with her husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Ackerley</strong></a>. Others producing include <strong>Robbie Brenner</strong>, <strong>Walter Parkes</strong>, <strong>David Heyman</strong>, real-life Mattel CEO <strong>Ynon Kreiz</strong>, and <strong>Josey McNamara</strong>.</p><h2>Barbie&nbsp;Soundtrack</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>There are&nbsp;so&nbsp;many artists featured on the highly-anticipated&nbsp;Barbie&nbsp;soundtrack.
