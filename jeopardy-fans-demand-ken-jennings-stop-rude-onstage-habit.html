">READ MORE JEOPARDY!</h2><p>"Consider this: In his last three games, Stephen has not managed to find a single one of the Daily Doubles available."</p><p>The host continued: "And yet, he won each of those games very convincingly, so take heart, Andrew and Sarah, he’s good, he’s very good, but the key to defeating him may lie in the three Daily Doubles in the game ahead.”</p><p>Sadly, after his eight-day winning streak, <a href=#>Stephen lost</a> to Kelly Barry on March 17.</p><h2>'JUST STOP!'</h2><p>Critical fans complained about his habit online.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"Wish Ken would stop bringing that up every time he introduces this guy," said one viewer.</p><p>"You know, I like both hosts for different reasons. But I didn't care for the remark Ken made at the start of tonight's show. Rude....just rude," wrote another social media user.</p><p>A third asked: "Does Ken not like Stephen?"</p><p>"Why does ken keep coming for Stephen during every intro?" asked an Instagram user.</p><p>"I love the show and I like both hosts but I have the same response to Ken tonight. He did it last night as well," complained another person.</p><p>To that, someone replied: "Agreed I cringed when Ken made that comment."</p><p>"Was a bit taken aback by Ken’s opening comment re Stephen’s lack of skill at finding daily doubles. He pulled it out with a salute at the end but man that middle part was kind of harsh. Sure wiped the smile off Stephen’s face. Felt for him. I am sure it was scripted but dang. On to the game.
