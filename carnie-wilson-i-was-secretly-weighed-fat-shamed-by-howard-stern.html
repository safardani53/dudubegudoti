The incident came just nine weeks after she underwent her first gastric bypass surgery to lose weight.</p><p>She recalled: “When I walked in, the producer Gary said, ‘Step over here and wait for Howard.’ Well, I didn’t know this, but I was stepping on a scale. And I looked up and in red, big numbers, 233 lbs. showed up on this thing. I said, ‘Wait a minute?’ and I looked down and all I could think was ‘Howard, ready to shame me?’ They purposely did it.”</p><p>Wilson said that Stern, 63, made embarrassing comments about her weight and even questioned <strong>Rob Bonfiglio</strong> – who she was engaged to at the time – about being with someone her size.</p><p>“He went nuts, just because he loves to fat-shame, he does. You know the way Howard is, always glamouring up all these thin women. But this is what happened, I always get Howard by the cajones. I said, ‘You know what, you’re really a piece of …’ I gave it back to him. I said, ‘This man really loves me,” she added.</p><p>“And [Stern] said, ‘You know what, I adore you,’ because it’s all a joke to him. But it wasn’t to me.”</p><p>During the interview with Stern, Wilson opened up her tough decision to get <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> surgery. “I was so desperate to lose the weight,” she said. “I didn’t feel good. It’s not all about looks. When I would walk down the street I was out of breath, my feet were hurting … Morbid obesity is a clinical disease.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Regardless of the banter, both ended the interview saying that they loved one another.</p><p>Weight has continued to be a struggle for Wilson. She chose to go under the knife again in 2012 for lap-band surgery after she struggled to keep the weight off postpartum. She revealed on The Talk in March 2017 that she will undergo surgery to remove ruptured breast implants that she had originally gotten after losing a great amount of weight from surgery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacmaKjtqZ51qKjrKeeYrZuw8CsZKydk6eytbjYZq6eoZedsqV5xZqrZquYlrqmsIybsGagn6yus7CMrKueqp5k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
