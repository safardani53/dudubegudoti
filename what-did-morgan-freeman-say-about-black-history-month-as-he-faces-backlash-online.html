As He Faces Backlash Online</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Morgan Freeman</strong>, an American actor, generated outrage online after expressing his displeasure with the labels “Black History Month” and “African-American.” The 85-year-old celebrity discussed race in an interview with The Sunday Times, which was published on April 15.</p><p>He stated:</p><p>“There are two things I can say publicly that I don’t like.” Black History Month is a slap in the face. “You’re going to limit my history to one month?”</p><p>He went on to say that the term “African-American” is equally derogatory, and that black people “have had different titles all the way back to the n-word.”</p><p>“I’m not sure how these terms became so popular, but everyone uses ‘African-American.’ What exactly does it mean? The majority of Black people in this region of the globe are hybrids. And you refer to Africa as if it were a nation, whereas it is a continent, like Europe.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Morgan-Freeman-2.jpg alt="Morgan Freeman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In contrast, he claims, individuals do not refer to themselves as Euro-Americans, but rather as Italian-Americans or Irish-Americans.</p><h2>The internet is split over Morgan Freeman’s Black History Month remarks.</h2><p>Morgan Freeman’s thoughts on Black History Month and the label “African-American” went viral, dividing the internet.&nbsp;Several commenters praised the actor for expressing truths and uniting black people. Others chastised Morgan Freeman for his “irresponsible” use of the term “Mongrels.”</p><p>Morgan Freeman discussed why inclusion in films and television programs is vital, in addition to Black History Month and the phrase African American.</p><p>“There was some in the movies when I was growing up.” If a black guy appeared in a film, he was amusing. Until Sidney Poitier came along and told young people like me, ‘OK, OK, I can do that.'”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Morgan-Freeman-2.jpg alt="Morgan Freeman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Morgan joined the entertainment business after the Hays Code, a censorship list that barred, among other things, clergy satire and interracial marriages. In 1968, it was overturned. Morgan went on to say:</p><p>“The difference now is that everyone is involved.” Everyone. LGBTQ people, Asians, black people, white people, interracial marriages, and interracial partnerships. Everyone is represented. You can now see them all on screen, which is a significant improvement.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Morgan Freeman says it’s ‘insulting’ to be called ‘African-American’<br><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/OvxyR9hMTw</a></p><p>— Brian Eskow (@realbrianeskow) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">April 16, 2023</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>This is what Morgan Freeman says:</p><p>“‘African-American’ is an insult.
