Within nine years, the shop expanded into malts and shakes. Two years later, banana splits popped up on menus and Dilly bars debuted four years after that. In the following years, the menu continued to expand with sweet innovations like parfaits, Blizzards, Treatzza Pizza and so forth.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After 83 years of treats, many food items that once graced the menu are long extinct. Here's a nostalgic reminder of what DQ used to serve.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>DQ Creamsicle Dipped Cone.</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dipped-cone></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Dipped Cone</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the latest discontinued items is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cherry dipped cone, which caused an uproar among fans</a>. But the red-colored ice cream topping joins a long list of other dipped flavors no longer at Dairy Queen. Butterscotch had been a staple dip until it was discontinued in 2009 (but has returned for a short time on several occasions), and limited-time dip flavors include blue raspberry, bubblegum, cotton candy, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dreamsicle</a> and banana.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But fans shouldn’t lose hope. A Dairy Queen representative told PEOPLE in May, "DQ is always rotating our dipped cone flavors and cherry dipped cones may return in the future. Fans should check with their local DQ restaurant to learn which flavors are available."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-monkey-tail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Monkey Tail</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This retro treat is simply a full, frozen banana dipped in chocolate and served on a stick (yep, just as simple as that!) and was introduced in the 1960s.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Considering the fact that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dairy Queen</a> is a franchise, individual owners can carry some different items at their respective locations. So, while the fruity dessert might not be available nationwide anymore, it is still sold at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Dairy Queen in Moorhead, Minn.</a>, along with several other discontinued items on this list.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bakes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Bakes</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a limited time, customers could order warmed up desserts à la mode. The chain started offering chocolate stuffed cookies, apple tarts and brownies served with a swirl of soft serve in 2015. The items were bumped off the menu by funnel cake and lava cake (also served with ice cream) but all of the desserts have since been removed from the menu.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>DQ Pinata Party Blizzard.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dairy Queen</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blizzards></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Blizzards</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These are the biggest category of DQ's discontinued items. Since the Blizzard’s inception in 1985, many flavors have come and gone. Part of the endless list of discontinued blended desserts is due to Dairy Queen’s Blizzard of the Month promotion where temporary flavors only grace the menu for brief stints.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some of the Blizzards no longer on the menu are inspired by other brands like Sour Patch Kids Blizzard, Thin Mints Blizzard and Drumstick Blizzard. Other discontinued flavors are more creative, like the piñata party Blizzard, red velvet cake Blizzard and cotton candy Blizzard.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-breeze></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Breeze</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1990, as frozen yogurt grew in popularity, the chain decided to try its hand at a healthier Blizzard. The Breeze had all the fix-in options as Blizzards but were made with frozen yogurt instead of soft serve ice cream and could also come with fruit. It had a decade of fame before being taken off the menu in 2000.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jets></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Jets</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to the desserts served via counter service at DQs, the chain also has desserts stored in a grab-and-go freezer. Now, Dilly bars and ice cream cakes are stored in these coolers but they used to house Jets, a push pop dessert introduced in the early 1960s.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mr-maltie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Mr. Maltie</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to a DQ Jet, these desserts were first served on a popsicle stick in the '60s. The pail-shaped treats were made with chocolate malted ice cream.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5GhuW7Ax55knaGjmLyvwMinrJ6cXZmuqr7YZqiunZWjeqO4yLOxmqqUqHqiusNmpq2glad6tb7EmqusZZ6keq27zaCcq2Wfo3q1tMRmpJ6mpWKEeoKTbGdw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
