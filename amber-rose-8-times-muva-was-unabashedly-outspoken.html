This is about me. If you don’t like it, I don’t care. I’m going to do anything and everything I want with my own life,” she explained to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>MOTTO</a> in January.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of the 32-year-old’s weekly talk show, The Amber Rose Show, which features pop culture coverage and celebrity interviews starting Friday on VH1 debut, here are some of Rose’s most unplugged moments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>1. When she launched the SlutWalk</b><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tired of the victim-blaming often tied to sexual violence, Rose helped orchestrate the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>SlutWalk</a> in Los Angeles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rose and activists gathered to call attention to what they say are double standards for women who are the victims of sex-related crimes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The event will get a second movement this October, Rose told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE</a>. “The point is you can wear whatever you want and it’s not an invitation,” she explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>2. When she wore a jumpsuit covered in insults</b><br>Hitting the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>2015 VMAs red carpet</a> with pal Blac Chyna, Rose put her haters on blast with a skin-tight nude ensemble covered with derogatory words like “bitch,” “hoe” and “slut.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They call us sluts and whores all the time, so we just embrace it,” Rose said. “I have slut written across my vagina.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>3. When she made the walk of “no” shame on camera</b><br>There’s no shame in the morning after, Rose assured in a 2015 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Funny or Die</a> sketch with How to Get Away with Murder‘s Matt McGorry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the sketch, titled “Walk of No Shame,” Rose was applauded for leaving a man’s house in the same ensemble as the night before.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Good morning! Say, it looks to me like you had sex last night,” a milkman asked Rose in the clip. After she said yes, the man responded, cheerfully, “Sounds like you’re living your best life!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>4. When she defended her child online – and tore down Kanye</b><br>Things did not end well between Rose and West, if their post-break up public interactions are any indication.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Rose’s son with ex Khalifa was brought up during a Twitter war between the rappers this January, she was quick to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>stand up for Sebastian</a> – albeit, with a little NSFW flair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You better not come for Sebastian. Not my baby. I will protect him,” she told PEOPLE of the incident.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She said of West in another interview with the Allegedly podcast: “It just shows the type of person he is. Even him saying stuff about my son, I still didn’t say anything about his kids. I’m not going to. This is ridiculous. They’re innocent babies. You don’t ever, ever talk about a baby, ever.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>RELATED VIDEO: Did Taylor Swift & Tom Hiddleston Move on Too Quickly Post-Calvin Harris?

From my own experience, a lot of guys find it very attractive,” and “You should always make sure you look presentable, even just for going to the corner store.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>6. When she launched her own emojis</b><br>Rose’s MuvaMojis are just as daring as the star’s personality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>https://www.instagram.com/p/BDteTTlEq8L/</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From a condom to some BDSM-inspired characters, Rose’s emojis cover quite the gamut.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>7. When she founded The Amber Rose Foundation</b><br>The Amber Rose Foundation, which helps run the SlutWalk, “is a not-for-profit organization that aims to promote discussion about women’s rights and equality issues.
