Gary Lee, Van‚Äôs brother, said on Facebook that he was extremely close to Van and will always miss him.&nbsp;He stated in a Facebook post on January 6 that Conner was hospitalized earlier this month for a liver infection and other health conditions he was diagnosed with around two years ago. Gary added that Van underwent stomach surgery in 2021, which put him in a stupor and prevented him from walking for a while. Gary went on to say,</p><p>‚ÄúWhile he was healing he took Covid which resulted in a blood clot in his lung. He could hardly walk after recuperating from Covid, and his lungs were severely injured. He‚Äôs been in a hospital bed at home for many months and seems to be making little progress toward recovery.‚Äù</p><p>He said that Van Conner originally refused to seek medical attention, but he was optimistic that things might change while he was in the hospital. Gary asked that everyone express their best wishes and prayers to Conner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Van-Conner-1.jpg alt="Van Conner" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>On Twitter, people pay respect to Van Conner.</h2><p>Van Conner rose to prominence as a member of Screaming Trees.
