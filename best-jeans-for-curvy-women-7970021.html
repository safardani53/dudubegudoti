Hang tight, as we've scoured the internet and found the best jeans for all body types, so you can finally add a favorite pair of jeans (or a few) to your closet. But with the vast variety of denim washes, styles, cuts, and fabrics out there, how do we know for sure which styles are best for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>women with curves</a>?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"As a curvy woman, the best kind of jeans should shape you from the hip to the waist, and mid- to high-rise [styles] are best," says Christine Rucci, denim expert and founder of Godmother NYC. But it's important to keep in mind that there's no set rule as to which styles curvy women should wear — it's simply up to the shopper what makes them feel great.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you dig skinny jeans, wide-leg denim, or something in between, we found the best jeans for curvy women.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-american-eagle-ae-stretch-curvy-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>American Eagle AE Stretch Curvy Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="American Eagle AE Stretch Curvy Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VzPQHPIj2_DHNx2_jyLahRzBfy4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/american-eagle--ae-stretch-curvy-straight-jeans-e626513832ca422c8a1b924fa1ad2d06.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>American Eagle</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Think of the AE Stretch Curvy Straight Jeans as the Goldilocks of denim: The pant legs are not too narrow, but not too wide, making them the best of both worlds. (Plus, the extra room around the hips makes this curve-friendly.) If you're looking for a true straight-leg jean, you might find these a bit too baggy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">American Eagle gives this classic style a personalized edge with three washes, an inclusive range of sizes, and multiple lengths to appeal to everyone (impressively, five different inseam options, to be exact).&nbsp;For a laidback look, pair them with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>comfy shacket</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>000-20, 5 lengths<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>94% cotton, 5% recycled cotton, 1% elastane<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>High | <strong>Style:</strong> Straight</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-signature-by-levi-strauss--co-gold-label-womens-modern-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.

For this reason and many more, we are obsessed with these best-selling Levi's jeans. These jeans are stretchy yet snug enough to hug the waist — you might want to grab a few pairs because they're that amazing. The skinny pull-on style has an elastic waistband that might not suit someone who prefers a traditional pair of zip-up jeans, but if you prioritize softness and stretch, these jeans are not to be missed. You can even deviate from the standard blue wash with one of the many colorful options to elevate your denim game.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>2-28<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>82% cotton, 15% polyester, 3% elastane<strong> </strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>Mid | <strong>Style:</strong> Skinny</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-runner-up-signature-by-levi-strauss--co-gold-label-womens-totally-shaping-pull-on-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget, Runner-Up</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.

These classic Levi's are an ideal choice when you want to flaunt a fashionable look while also feeling comfy. We recommend pairing these skinnies with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stylish booties</a> and a chic, oversized top.

While the wide legs look super stylish, they may not be ideal for a professional setting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, the high-rise cut has an extra two inches of room at the hips and thighs so you’ll find a pair that fits your curves without having an unnecessary waist gap. If you love the look of baggy denim, here’s your sign to grab a few: Abercrombie’s pair is available in an inclusive size range, five washes — from stone to gray to black — and five inseam length options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>23-37 |<strong> Material:</strong> 77% cotton, 23% lyocell |<strong> Rise: </strong>High | <strong>Style:</strong> Baggy</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cheeky-everlane-the-curvy-90s-cheeky-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cheeky</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Curvy ’90s Cheeky Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Curvy &amp;acirc;90s Cheeky Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SLIQhP_mQCP1hN2xoJVLeue0zvY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-curvy-90s-cheeky-jean-26bade3125b0462f93e51ce2c9dbe61d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're like us, you know it can be a struggle to find a pair of jeans that are comfortable and stylish. This pair of Everlane jeans delivers standout results. With an adjusted hip-to-waist ratio, these jeans will hug your curves with no gap at the waist. Keep in mind that these jeans are non-stretch, so the denim doesn't have any give, but the high-rise style features "happy pockets" to make your butt look extra perky. Coming in a variety of washes and both an ankle and regular length, these straight-leg jeans are destined to become your new favorite.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>23-33 |<strong> Material: </strong>100% organic cotton |<strong> Rise: </strong>11.5 inches | <strong>Style:</strong> Straight leg</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-low-rise-abercrombie--fitch-curve-love-low-rise-baggy-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Low-Rise</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch Curve Love Low Rise Baggy Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie Curve Love Low Rise Baggy Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ORUlD12kdLK-nkfSjERBZZQkbQk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/abercrombie--curve-love-low-rise-baggy-jeans--8686a0c53f5a443bb20c0830d8e5b4d7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Low-rise jeans, a controversial yet popular style that took over the ‘90s and early aughts, has made its way around again in the early 2020s. But, before you write off the low-slung style as “not for you,” have a look at Abercrombie’s Curve Love Low-Rise Baggy Jeans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here, the low waistline is offset with a little bit of slouch so they’re both comfortable and trend-conscious.

This light-wash pair comes in a diverse range of sizes (hello, 00-30) and regular, tall, and petite hemlines.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, the fit is where this pick shines.

There are also two Secret-Smooth front pockets, which make it possible to store loose change or your credit card without bulking up your denim. These jeans are simple, so anyone looking for a lot of special details might want to consider a different pair, but for a jean that will look good with just about anything, we think these are a great pick, We understand that not everyone wants to splash out on a new pair of denim, so this pair’s affordable price tag is a nice bonus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>00-30<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>83% cotton, 11% recycled polyester, 5% recycled cotton, 1% spandex<strong> </strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>High | <strong>Style:</strong> Straight leg</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-90s-abercrombie-curve-love-ultra-90s-high-rise-straight-jeans-light-with-criss-cross-waistband></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best '90s</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie Curve Love Ultra 90s High Rise Straight Jeans Light With Criss-Cross Waistband</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie Curve Love Ultra 90s High Rise Straight Jeans Light With Criss-Cross Waistband" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/yBaH8GP_AaDtPLkMmM6U5c6BO28=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/abercrombie--curve-love-ultra-90s-high-rise-straight-jeans-light-with-criss-cross-waistband--9d4546ed1ef94f3c9ae60b97c51eba71.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone loves a good pair of ‘90s-inspired jeans, and this style is made even better by its crossover waistband that accentuates your natural waistline. This relaxed-fit style is loose-fitting from the thighs down, and you can even choose to size up for a looser, lower-slung look. If you prefer a classic, straight waistline, we totally understand, but normal waistbands are boring — switch it up with this asymmetrical style that’s sure to separate you from the crowd.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>23-37<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>99% cotton, 1% elastane<strong> </strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>High | <strong>Style:</strong> Straight</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-short-women-gap-midrise-girlfriend-jeans-with-washwell></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Short Women</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gap Midrise Girlfriend Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gap Midrise Girlfriend Jeans with Washwell" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/j0JUPE6SseIBpH8YfML6je7hUQw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Gap-Mid-Rise-Girlfriend-Jeans-640eabf8eb1b4bcf842cf4d2ab37c56a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gap</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As shoppers who fall on the shorter side know all too well, finding a great pair of jeans that don’t need to be hemmed can be challenging. However, Gap is making the daunting task a little easier with its Mid-Rise Girlfriend Jeans. Not only are these medium-wash jeans available in three lengths — tall, regular, and petite — but their legs also hit nicely at the ankle so they have a slightly cropped fit, making them the perfect jeans for short women. The cropped ankle isn't for everyone, so if you're not in favor of it, we have plenty of other options for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might buy Gap’s Mid-Rise Girlfriend Jeans for their petite-approved silhouette, but their comfort will make them a key pair in your denim rotation.

Between the snugness around the thighs and hips and&nbsp;the higher back-rise for a booty-enhancing lift, this straight-legged pair is built to celebrate all your curves. (There are even four length options, including petite, so you won’t have to worry about your inseam, either.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The non-stretch denim might seem a bit tight at first, but once you break them in, your jeans will have a nice fits-like-a-glove shape — no tailor required.

Thanks to Good American's inclusive sizing, not only does this pair provide a cinched fit at the waistline, but it also embraces curves. They're form-fitting with just enough stretch and come in a few different blue washes, as well. If you prefer jeans with a looser fit, these may not be your best bet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we love the ultra-high waist, some people may feel the zipper and button placement to be uncomfortable since they sit at a different place than most jeans you may be used to. However, if you're not bothered by it, we recommend wearing them with a band tee and booties for a cool, relaxed outfit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>00-26<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>94.8% organic cotton, 3.7% elasterel-p, 1.5% elastane<strong> </strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>Super high | <strong>Style:</strong> Skinny</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-distressed-american-eagle-strigid-curvy-super-high-waisted-baggy-wide-leg-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Distressed</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>American Eagle Strigid Curvy Super High-Waisted Baggy Wide-Leg Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="American Eagle Strigid Curvy Super High-Waisted Baggy Wide-Leg Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KARnwEX-yAZkwODaYk9j2zIpmdI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/american-eagle-strigid-curvy-super-high-waisted-baggy-wide-leg-jean-52a506ae83e9438783c719ad3c43bc7a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>American Eagle</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just because you're looking for some curve-approved jeans doesn’t mean you have to opt for a figure-hugging pair of skinnies or straight-legs. Case in point: American Eagle's Strigid Curvy Super High-Waisted Ripped Baggy Straight Jean, which comes in three inseam lengths. Petite shoppers with shorter legs might find that the wider silhouette contains too much fabric, but if you like the fit, these jeans offer a refined take on the trendy baggy style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike typical baggy jeans — which are wide, but veer on the more casual end of the denim spectrum — this pair gradually has just the right amount of volume to offer a dash of polish of drama. And, when paired with a high-rise waistline, these soft-meets-stretchy jeans can create the illusion of elongated legs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>000-20<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>99% cotton, 1% elastane |<strong> Rise: </strong>High | <strong>Style:</strong> Wide leg</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-agolde-90s-mid-rise-loose-fit-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Agolde '90s Mid Rise Loose Fit Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="AGOLDE '90s Mid Rise Loose Fit Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/omxLZI0G8FKr30jOpw3VQZhl2Q8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign74-61a19b1362a847d08e07e525dd14496e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're in the mood to treat yourself, we found the most fabulous pair of jeans to do so: Agolde's '90s Mid-Rise Loose Fit Jeans. You can easily dress them up or down with heels or sneakers. The quality and style of these jeans are hard to beat, but according to the site’s measurements, new customers are advised to order down a size or two from their normal jeans size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">High-quality denim with a relaxed fit, these jeans have intentional distressing and a baggier silhouette than your classic jeans — so traditionalists may prefer other styles. Plus, it's not as size-inclusive as other options on this list. If you're ready to invest in this celeb-loved brand, though, this is a pair you'll keep re-wearing season to season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>23-34<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>100% cotton<strong> </strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>Mid | <strong>Style:</strong> Loose</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-jeans-for-curvy-women></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right Jeans for Curvy Women</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rise</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most important aspects of the way jeans fit is the height, or the rise, of the waist. The most common rises are low, mid, and high, though you can find several options that are super high (take the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Good American Good Waist Skinny Jean</a>, for example). “A mid to high-rise is best to accentuate the waist,” Rucci says. “And trouser-type flares [can] elongate the body,” she adds, suggesting a cropped or fitted jacket to complete the look.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Waistband</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now that we’ve touched on the importance of the rise, let’s look at the band itself. Rucci considers a contoured waistband to be very important when it comes to curvy jeans. She looks for ones that are “slightly higher [in the] back, wrap the waist and dip slightly in the front (just below the belly button)” to accentuate and make the waist pop. Styles like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Madewell’s The Curvy ‘90s Straight Jean</a> have a higher back, which Rucci says “offers the most comfort” while still providing shape.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Denim jeans may be a classic, but there are several styles that you can choose from to make your jeans personal to you.
