It's not entertainment; it's art," Dinklage told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> in 2015. "She's very inspiring.

Yeah. I mean, essentially, yes, that's true," Dinklage responded. "For an actor, you always wanna do something that — for me at least — that scares you … I just never had sung since I was a kid."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And the role was an important one for Dinklage for another reason. The play was originally written by Edmond Rostand in 1897, and the character Cyrano has been played by the likes of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Steve Martin</a>, José Ferrer and James Mason, among others.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Nine times out of 10, Cyrano is played by a handsome actor with a fake nose and you know that he takes it off when they wrap," Dinklage told U.K. outlet The Times. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The idea of a leading actor is changing now</a>. Whether racially or whatever. It's about time. We've been stuck with this stereotype of a leading man and it's healthy to open that up. Love life is not the domain of pretty people — everybody has a love life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to Cyrano, the couple also worked together in 2015 on Schmidt's stage adaptation of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>A Month in the Country</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-dinklage-met-in-new-york-city></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Dinklage met in New York City</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dinklage described meeting Schmidt as something out of a "crazy, romantic movie." In a 2021 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>, Dinklage said the two met at a mutual friend's house in N.Y.C.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was about 18 years ago now. We were all at a friend's house and someone said, 'They're walking the elephants through the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.' The circus was in town and it was snowing, and they were walking the elephants through Manhattan, a long line of them. It was like something out of a beautiful, fantastical, end-of-the-world, crazy, romantic movie," Dinklage recalled. "See? I always think about movies. So that's the night we met, the night the elephants walked through Manhattan."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-dinklage-eloped-in-las-vegas></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Dinklage eloped in Las Vegas</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gregg DeGuire/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2005, Dinklage and Schmidt eloped in Las Vegas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was going there for a charity event," Dinklage said during a 2016 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>. "And then while we were there, we just decided to do it. It was a bit lonely.

Although Schmidt was pregnant at the opening of her 2017 play, All the Fine Boys, the ultra-private couple have yet to share the sex of their second child.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both of their children's names are still a mystery to the public as well, but Dinklage has had quite a few laughs about the internet's many guesses — including one particular guess that he named his daughter Zelig after the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Woody Allen</a> movie of the same name.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love that Woody Allen movie," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>, referencing Allen's 1983 mockumentary.

After briefly mentioning that he forgot to thank her when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>he won an Emmy back in 2015</a>, Dinklage made sure to recognize his wife this time around, saying, "Thank you, Erica, for putting up with me.
