They were never married and broke up a few months after their son was born. While Justin's mother didn't have more children, the "Sorry" singer has four siblings from his father: sisters Jazmyn, Allie and Bay, and brother Jaxon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Justin has been open about the ups and downs he experienced with his parents over the years, the Biebers seem to be a tight-knit group. The family has celebrated holidays together and spent time in Canada, which they've documented on social media.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer has also said that family comes first. In 2019, while updating fans about his struggle with mental health, he said he was taking a step back from music to focus on himself, his marriage and eventually "be the father I want to be."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, "Music is very important to me, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>nothing comes before my family</a> and my health."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From his relationships with his mother and father to his four younger siblings, here's everything to know about Justin Bieber's family.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pattie-mallette></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Pattie Mallette</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Pattie Mallette smiling.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pattie Mallette Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Justin's mother, Pattie, was born in 1975 in Ontario, and welcomed Justin when she was 18 years old. According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Billboard</a>, Pattie encouraged Justin's musical talent at a young age, entering him in talent shows and posting his performances on YouTube, which is how he ultimately got discovered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pattie has been by her son's side since the start of his fame, from Justin's initial visit to Atlanta to meet manager Scooter Braun to signing with a record label. She also appeared in Justin's 2011 documentary Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, which chronicled the musician's rise to stardom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's really fun watching him grow and transition," Pattie told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>MTV News</a> in 2013. "It's just been this crazy whirlwind, and I'm just along for the ride."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Pattie has supported Justin's career, they were estranged for two years when Justin was in the press for poor public behavior.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, the pop star told Billboard that their relationship was "pretty nonexisting." He explained, "I was distant because I was ashamed. I never wanted my mom to be disappointed in me and I knew she was. We spent some time not talking, so it takes time to rebuild that trust. She's living in Hawaii now, so it's hard, but getting better. She's an amazing woman and I love her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The mother-son duo <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reunited in January 2018</a> for a vacation together, and Pattie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>shared a photo of the two in an embrace</a> with a sweet caption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm so proud of the amazing young man you are, and the young man you are becoming," she wrote. "I admire your character and integrity. You are maturing beautifully and wise beyond your years."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mallette attended the Los Angeles leg of Justin's Justice Tour</a>, sharing photos and videos from the show on social media. "GREAT SHOW TONIGHT IN LA BABY!!! ⚡️ #justinbieber #justicetour," she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pattie also seemingly has a close relationship with Justin's wife, Hailey Bieber, whom he wed in September 2018. One day after Justin and Hailey secretly tied the knot, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pattie celebrated the couple</a> by tweeting, “Love is unconditional.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Hailey's 26th birthday in November 2022, she shared a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>selfie with her daughter-in-law</a> on Instagram, writing, "May this year be full of good surprises and lots of love. Your strength and kindness are inspiring. So grateful you were born!

While he shares Justin with ex Pattie, he also is a father of four other children: He shares daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon with ex Erin Wagner, and daughter Bay with his wife Chelsey Rebelo, as well as Chelsey's daughter Allie from a previous relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Justin's relationship with his father has experienced ups and downs over the years, the two have a strong bond. The singer told Billboard in 2015 that his father was "not in a place where he could raise a kid" when Justin was younger.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was immature. He left for like a year when I was about 4, went to British Columbia, came back on Father's Day," Justin recalled. "I remember my mom said, 'If you're going to be here, you have to be here.' There's a misconception that he's this deadbeat dad, but he has been in my life since. I was with him on weekends and Wednesdays."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2016, however, Justin told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GQ</a> that he was "a lot closer to my dad than I am to my mom" at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer opened up about his relationship with Jeremy again in December 2017, sharing a photo of the two on Instagram and writing, "I️ love continuing to get to know my father I️ love working through hard things to get to the good things.. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>relationships are worth fighting for</a> especially with family!! Love you forever and always daddy!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few months later, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Justin served as a groomsman at his father's wedding</a> to wife Chelsey. Jeremy and Chelsey tied the knot in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in February 2018, and the pop star was pictured enthusiastically applauding during the ceremony.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "Peaches" singer is "honored" to be Jeremy's son and praised his father in a 2022 post for Father's Day. "Love you pops!" he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>captioned a throwback photo</a>. "Happy Father's Day! So much to look forward to.

He later served as a groomsman at Jeremy and Chelsey's 2018 wedding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chelsey shares one child with Jeremy, daughter Bay, and teenage daughter Allie from a previous relationship.
