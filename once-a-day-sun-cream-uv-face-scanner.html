Laura Stott tested four SPF products using a professional UV face scanner with input from skin specialist Dr Aamer Khan at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harley Street Skin Clinic</a>.</p><p>The results may change your holiday habits for good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508129405.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How we tested them</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>PRODUCTS were tested using a Visia Face Scanner, which shows where sunscreen is present on skin.</p><p>The darker the image the higher the SPF and protection from UV radiation. Pale areas, white patches and speckles show less SPF on the skin so less protection.</p><p>Each day I applied a different once-a-day SPF in the morning and did the initial scan. I carried out normal activities such as working, travelling and eating meals. I didn’t exercise, swim, sunbathe, wash or apply other cosmetics. Eight hours later a second scan showed how much protection remained on my face.</p><p>All products were applied as per the instructions given on the bottle.</p><h2>Piz Buin: Alarmed at level of exposure</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508129403.jpg><p><strong>BEFORE:</strong> Labelled as once-a-day lotion but&nbsp;small print says it gives only up to six hours of sweat and water-resistant protection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508127914-e1564604709621.jpg><p>Easy to apply, with a three-star UVA rating. I loved the distinctive holiday smell.</p><p>The first scan showed less protection than expected, with white areas around eyes and lips, alongside speckles of UV exposure on my cheeks and forehead.</p><p><strong>AFTER:</strong> Piz Buin does state six hours’ protection but it is alarming quite how much of my face is now white and exposed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508127662-e1564604882793.jpg><p><strong>Dr Khan says:</strong> This has not given all-day even protection. The second scan shows coverage has decreased over time meaning we can now see right through to your skin.</p><p>Chemical sunscreen absorbs into the skin and then absorbs UV rays so it’s difficult to say how well it would actually work after a whole day’s wear. If you plan to use this, I would suggest frequently topping up, regardless of the circumstances, to cut risk of sun damage, skin ageing and potential cancers.</p><h2>Ultrasun: Almost no protection at 8hrs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508129360-e1564602908283.jpg><p><strong>BEFORE:</strong> The UltraSun guide gives a coverage time based on your specific skin type, suggesting my fair skin will receive ten hours of protection time, but recommending a maximum of seven hours of sun exposure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508129640-e1564605743743.jpg><p>Free from oils, emulsifiers and perfume, this SPF is suitable for sensitive skins and gives 93 per cent UVA protection.</p><p>It is formulated with Lamellar structures such that it absorbs quickly below the skin’s surface leaving minimal residue.</p><p>I liked the nifty pump dispenser and mousse texture but the lotion felt clammy on my skin.<br>The initial scan showed surprisingly thin and light coverage, with exposed patches on my forehead and nose.</p><p><strong>AFTER:</strong> The second scan for this cream showed numerous white patches, gaps and lines clearly visible on my skin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508129655-e1564605887157.jpg><p><strong>Dr Khan says:</strong> Despite this being labelled “family” SPF I don’t recommend relying on <strong>ANY</strong> brand of SPF product to protect children all day.</p><p>This SPF has not fared well and on the second scan has worn off consistently and symmetrically on the face. You are certainly left with almost no physical protection after eight hours,&nbsp;although there may still be chemical protection remaining on the skin.</p><h2>Calypso: Light texture did not feel sticky</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508129385.jpg><ul><li><strong>Calypso Once A Day Sun Lotion, SPF20, 200ml (£6, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wilko.com</a>)</strong></li></ul><p><strong>BEFORE:</strong> I really like the gel texture of this bargain-priced chemical SPF with antioxidants and a four-star UVA rating. It disperses easily and dries fast, with no scent at all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508127640-e1564605998214.jpg><p>Because it is clear it is hard to tell if I have achieved an even coating when applying. The first scan shows good initial protection, especially on my forehead, but it’s patchy in other areas.</p><p>There is some white speckling visible on my cheeks, around my eyes and across the bridge of my nose.</p><p><strong>AFTER:</strong> This product was my favourite to wear all day as its light texture didn’t feel sticky. Eight hours later, the coverage is still visible on my skin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508127692-e1564606201225.jpg><p><strong>Dr Khan says:</strong> This chemical and anti-oxidant SPF has performed fairly well.</p><p>There’s a reasonable amount of product left on the skin but once again the coverage is inconsistent after eight hours and it has worn off in patches, particularly around the chin and forehead areas.</p><p>Always remember a one-day-cream can be sweated, rubbed or washed off just like normal SPF lotion. Being “once-a-day” does not make this less likely to happen.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in fabulous</h2></p><h2>Soltan: Remained active in some areas</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508129368.jpg><ul><li><strong>Boots Soltan Once 8hr Protect, SPF30, 200ml (£10 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Boots.com</a>)</strong></li></ul><p><strong>BEFORE:</strong> Boot’s Soltan lotion has the highest available five-star UVA rating, is water resistant and described as moisturising.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508127837-e1564606413749.jpg><p>The thick yellow-tinged lotion didn’t sink in and felt unpleasantly greasy, but this did ensure I had to apply a really good covering to my skin. The first scan shows excellent initial protection over my entire face. There are just a few areas of white around my eyes where I have missed areas when applying.</p><p>I could still feel a sticky layer on my face when I return for my second scan – suggesting the skin was coated in SPF.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508127968-e1564606531471.jpg><p><strong>AFTER:</strong> Some areas are still showing excellent protection, but white patches show others are now SPF-free and exposed.</p><p><strong>Dr Khan says:</strong> Coverage was excellent when the cream was first applied and in areas it is still good, but the product has not remained where you put it.</p><p>The “after” scan shows it has migrated and shifted on the skin, probably due to movement of facial muscles. You did get eight hours coverage but it’s not complete coverage. I’d suggest reapplying every two hours.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>8 essential beauty products to help you survive a heatwave</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5hvaXFrY2t8sLrCnmSaZZSWxm6%2F1KdknKqVlrpuwdVmnZqblWLApK3Np5yrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
