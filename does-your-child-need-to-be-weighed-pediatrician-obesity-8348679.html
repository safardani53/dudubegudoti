Research shows that even a modest weight loss of 5 percent can result in health benefits.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And obesity in childhood can be detrimental to a person’s overall health, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>National Library of Medicine</a> (NLM) reported, with almost 19 percent of children affected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Obesity</a> is associated with a number of immediate and long-term physical and psychosocial health consequences including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem,” the NLM says. “Thus, to maximize health and quality of life, it is imperative to identify, prevent, and manage obesity during childhood.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But parents like Caroline Hardin, who told her daughter’s pediatrician she wanted “a body neutral and body positive environment,” are often adverse to discussing weight.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Do children need to be weighed at the pediatrician's office?.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Many providers…worry that parents will react negatively to discussions about their child’s weight and indicated that parental opposition to discussions about weight were disruptive to obesity prevention efforts,” the NLM says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And those parents have a reason to be concerned about weight discussions. "There are concerns that obesity prevention efforts may lead to the development of an ED [eating disorder]," the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>American Association of Pediatrics</a> (AAP) says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It adds: “Most adolescents who develop an ED did not have obesity previously, but some adolescents may misinterpret what 'healthy eating' is and engage in unhealthy behaviors."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the AAP doesn’t tell pediatricians to avoid discussing a child’s weight — especially when it presents a health concern.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead, the organization <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>advises</a> that doctors use inclusive language, ”using the term ‘child with obesity,’ rather than ‘obese child’ ” as “pediatricians and other [primary health-care providers] PHCPs have been — and remain — a source of weight bias.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The AAP also says doctors need to consider other socioeconomic and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>racial factors</a>, and focus on “nutrition counseling” over “a structured diet.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adults can opt-out of being weighed at the doctor — although some medications (like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>birth control</a>) — require a person’s weight for correct dosing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The same is true for some children’s medication, as even Tylenol’s dosing is determined by weight. As <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Time Magazine</a> pointed out, “Pediatricians need to know how much kids weigh, at least periodically. But that doesn’t mean they need to talk about it in ways that cause harm.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Given the anxiety that patients often go through when being weighed, having a full metabolic panel is often an acceptable substitute," Dr. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>David P. Selzer</a>, an internal medicine doctor at NYU Langone, told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Well + Good</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Rather than focusing on one data point, our top priority is to ensure that each patient is comfortable during their appointment," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And if there comes a time to discuss a patient’s weight, the NIH recommends that physicians “open the discussion about weight in a respectful and nonjudgmental way. Patients may be more open if they feel respected.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>'s free daily newsletter</a>&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5SksrR52Kisq2WTnbatsIynnJ6cXam8bq7EZq6eoZedsqV5z56bopmkp7aktcCnZKialai2tcWMcWptcGZshg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
