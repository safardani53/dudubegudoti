I'd be embarrassed …"</p><p>Another celebrated: "No better ego boost than getting final jeopardy right when none of the contestants do."</p><p>One <a href=#>Reddit</a> user wrote: "I found the final question to be an easy one today, I'm quite surprised no one got it."</p><p>Another wrote: "I blanked out and landed on Dallas. I couldn't pin down the years it ran. The 'named character' had me wondering. Turns out it ran later than I thought."</p><p>A third commented in the thread: "Today's final Jeopardy was soooo easy."</p><p>A fourth defended: "I wrote down MASH as well, despite thinking to myself, 'Wasn’t MASH a comedy…?' Glad to see I was in good company with Dillon and Johanna."</p><p>A fifth wrote: "Like 2 of the contestants, I said MASH. I knew Magnum takes place in Hawaii, and the correct response did occur to me as well, so it was a bit of a coin flip."</p><p>"Great game from all three players, but happy to see Johanna walk away with it!"</p><p>"I think they were trying to think of a long-running show that ended ~1980, and decided to just write down something."</p><p>One more wrote: "When will this 1-3 game curse end? This month's been rough so far."</p><h2>JEOPARDY!
