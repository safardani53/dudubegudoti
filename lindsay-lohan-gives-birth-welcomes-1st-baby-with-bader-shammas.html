She was always told, ‘You can’t do both,’ but she knows she can. She <a href=#>can be a wife, a mom and an actress</a>,” the insider said at the time. “She’s filming another two movies. She can still do it and isn’t showing just yet.”</p><p>Although <a href=#>the former child star</a> is committed to her career, the source noted that she “wants balance” between home life and work life once the baby arrives. The <i>Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen</i> star is in the midst of her “Lohanaissance,” which began with her starring turn in the 2022 <a href=#>Netflix</a> film <a href=#><i>Falling For Christmas</i></a>. Following this movie, she made a two-picture deal with Netflix, including <i>Irish Wish</i>, which will be released in 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lindsay-Lohan-Through-the-Years-2023.jpg><p>“She wants to be a family mom and not just a working mom,” the insider explained. “[She] wants to be home raising the baby, but she will continue working.”</p><p>Lohan went public with Shammas in February 2020, and he has been supporting the <i>I Know Who Killed Me</i> actress in every aspect of her life ever since.</p><p>“Bader is now working with her and helping to manage her with [her mom] Dina [Lohan]. He’s <a href=#>really helped Lindsay become who she is today</a> and she really trusts him,” a second source told <i>Us</i> in March. “Bader genuinely just wants to support her and help her continue on the right track.”</p><p>After <a href=#>getting engaged in November 2021</a>, the pair secretly tied the knot five months later. In a birthday tribute to the businessman, Lohan revealed the news when referring to Shammas as her “husband.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Celebrities-Who-Welcomed-Babies-in-2023-Lindsay-Lohan-and-Bader-Shammas-.jpg><p>“🎂❤️🥰I am the luckiest woman in the world. Not because I need a man, but because he found me and knew that I wanted to find happiness and grace, all at the same time,” the Freaky Friday actress wrote via<a href=#> Instagram</a> in July 2022. “I am stunned that this is my husband. My life and my everything. ❤️every woman should feel like this everyday 💖🙏.”</p><p>In January 2019, Lohan may have predicted what her happily ever after would look like.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I want to date a guy that’s a businessman — doesn’t have Instagram, doesn’t have social media, and is completely off the grid in terms of that kind of stuff,” the “Daughter to Father” artist told <strong><a href=#>Howard Stern</a></strong> at the time. “I think it will happen when it’s meant to happen.”</p><p>Lohan was previously engaged to <a href=#><strong>Egor Tarabasov</strong></a>, who <a href=#>she split from</a> in July 2016. In addition to Shammas and Tarabasov, 29, the “First” singer also had high-profile relationships with <a href=#><strong>Wilmer Valderrama</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Samantha Ronson</strong></a> and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaloZ6ZwKLFjKWmoZmeYrSqwsSsZJuhoqm1bsPEpZqopZWoenK%2F02aZmpqpYsSqwMdmmZqclad6tLTApqSaq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
