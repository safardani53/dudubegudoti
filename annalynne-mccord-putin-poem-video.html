So much laughter and joy. Nothing would harm. I can’t imagine the stain. The soul-stealing pain. That the little boy, you must have seen. And believed.

Perhaps you would hold dear human life, and on this night, instead of Mother Russia, you would call me. And I would set your mind quite free with the love that only a mother can give.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dear Mister President Vladimir Putin… <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/LbDFBHVWJf</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>— AnnaLynne McCord (@IAMannalynnemcc) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 24, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The gestured failed to win over fans. “Just sing ‘<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>imagine</a>‘ next time.
