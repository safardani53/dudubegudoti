Though she didn’t tag Mescal in her post, he chimed in with a cheeky response, replying, “I’m officially dead.”</p><p>Soon after their flirty social media exchange, the pair cohosted an Instagram Live conversation for Wonderland magazine. By December 2020, Mescal had starred in <a href=#>one of Bridgers’ music videos</a>. When asked how the project came about, the “I Know the End” singer credited the Irish actor with the idea.</p><p>“He broached it. He was like, ‘I’m a fan of yours, let’s make something cool,'” she told British Vogue in December 2020. “And he told me about the Rolling Stones video [he did for ‘Scarlet’], and then I brought it to <a href=#><strong>Phoebe</strong></a> [<a href=#><strong>Waller-Bridge</strong></a>] and she was like, ‘Yeah, it’s too serendipitous to not do it, the fact that I told you to watch Normal People and now you guys are friends.'”</p><p>Waller-Bridge directed the video and had previously agreed to meet the “Georgia” artist for drinks before the <a href=#>coronavirus pandemic</a> hit in early 2020. When their plans fell through, the <a href=#>Fleabag</a> creator encouraged the “Savior Complex” artist to watch Mescal’s hit show.</p><p>“I was like, ‘I’m not going to do that, it’s too depressing,'” Bridgers told the outlet. “I had read the book while making the record and it really destroyed me for a couple of days. Their performances are beautiful, but I can’t deal with it [laughs]. I had to skip the whole prom s–t, because it destroyed me already once in my life.”</p><p>Ahead of their music video collab, fans began to wonder whether the indie singer and the actor had sparked a <a href=#>romantic connection</a> when Bridgers was spotted overseas. The then-rumored couple were caught canoodling at a local cafe in July 2020.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though they each continued to drop subtle hints about their respective relationship statuses, it wasn’t until November 2021 that the pair <a href=#>attended their first official event</a> together. Bridgers took the next step one month later, <a href=#>confirming their romance</a> with a PDA pic on Instagram.</p><p>Scroll down to relive the low-key couple’s whirlwind romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvam7xJucZpqinrGosdGsZKmZpaF6rrHSnJilq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uwMimnKWhnpp6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
