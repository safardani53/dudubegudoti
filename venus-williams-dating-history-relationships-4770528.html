However the Grand-Slam champion has had some steamy long-term relationships in the past both in and out of the media’s eye.&nbsp;Although she was often seen with fellow tennis player <strong>Reilly Opeka</strong>, she shot down rumors that they were dating in an Instagram story in 2021. But who has Venus really been with? Keep reading to find out more details.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Venus started dating millionaire<strong> Nicholas Hammond</strong> in 2017. Nicholas is 12 years Venus’ junior, and is an heir to a “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>vast communications empire</a>,” which included magazines such as&nbsp;TV Guide&nbsp;and&nbsp;Seventeen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>During their two-year relationship, the pair were no strangers to PDA. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>They attended</a> Venus’ sister <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Serena</strong></a>‘s wedding together, and were photographed getting cozy while on a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dinner date</a> in December of 2017. “She’s head over heels for him” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Daily News&nbsp;</a>when he accompanied her to the 2018 Australian Open matches.

There, they were seen holding hands and getting affectionate, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. In March 2013, Venus and Elio got hot and heavy on her court in Miami, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Mail</a>.
