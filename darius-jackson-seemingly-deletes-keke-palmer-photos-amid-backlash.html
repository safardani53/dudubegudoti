Jackson, who has been dating Palmer since 2021, <a href=#>wasn’t pleased with the revealing dress</a> she wore to a recent <a href=#><strong>Usher</strong></a> concert in Las Vegas.</p><p class=p1>“It’s the outfit tho … you a mom,” he wrote in a since-deleted tweet on Wednesday, July 5, reposting a video of Palmer dancing at the show.</p><p class=p1>Jackson added in a second post: “We live in a generation where a man of the family doesn’t want the wife & mother to his kids to showcase booty cheeks to please others & he gets told how much of a hater he is. This is my family & my representation. I have standards & morals to what I believe. I rest my case.”</p><p class=p1>Social media users quickly chimed in on the controversy, slamming Jackson for <a href=#>shaming Palmer’s outfit choice</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I just want to say I don’t know Keke Palmer’s boyfriend. I don’t know anything about him really besides the current thing, but let me just say I hate that man,” <a href=#><strong>Kimora Lee Simmons</strong></a>’ daughter <a href=#>Aoki</a> said in a since-deleted TikTok video on Thursday, per&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Entertainment Tonight</i></a>. “I pray and plot on his downfall. I hate him. I’m disgusted. I think when my friend told me that and we was just sitting … I was like ‘What?’ I would love the chance to, like, punch that man. … I am appalled. No couth.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Darius-Jackson-Reactivates-Social-Media-Seemingly-Deletes-Photos-of-Keke-Palmer-Amid-Backlash-2.jpg><p class=p1>Palmer has yet to speak publicly on the drama. Upon Jackson’s return to Twitter and Instagram, eagle-eyed fans noticed all previous posts featuring Palmer have seemingly been scrubbed from his profiles. Jackson’s most recent upload — shared in June — is a <a href=#>solo pic of him with the pair’s son</a>, Leodis Andrellton, whom <a href=#>they welcomed in February</a>.</p><p class=p1>Palmer and Jackson were <a href=#>first linked in the summer of 2021</a>, nearly two years before announcing they were <a href=#>expecting their first baby</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Darius-Jackson-Reactivates-Social-Media-Seemingly-Deletes-Photos-of-Keke-Palmer-Amid-Backlash-4.jpg><p class=p1>“There’s some rumors going around, people have been in my comments saying, ‘Keke’s having a baby, Keke’s pregnant,’ and I wanna set the record straight — I am,” <a href=#>she quipped during her&nbsp;<i>Saturday Night Live&nbsp;</i>monologue</a> in December 2022, revealing her baby bump for the first time. “I mean, like, I was trying so hard to keep it on the down low, ‘cause I got a lot of stuff going on, you know? People kept coming up to me [and saying,] ‘Congratulations.’ I’m like, ‘Sssh, can y’all stop, I got a liquor sponsorship on the line. Let the check clear and then&nbsp;we can get to the damn baby shower!’”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “But, honestly&nbsp;this has been the biggest blessing, and I am so excited. Guys, I’m going to be a mom! Even though some people feel a little weird about me having a baby ‘cause I was a child actor, I just wanna say, ‘Look, I’m 29, I’m grown, I have sex [and] I own a home. … You know, things adults do.’”</p><p class=p1>Despite her boyfriend’s critiques, Palmer shared more snapshots from<a href=#> her evening in Sin City</a>. Several stars have since taken to the comments section of the<a href=#> Instagram</a> post to praise <a href=#>her impressive postpartum physique</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p4>“Can I borrow this outfit @keke? Because if it makes me feel anywhere near as good as you look and feel in it post-baby, I’m ready,” <a href=#><strong>Jessie J</strong></a> — who <a href=#>gave birth to son Sky</a> in May — gushed on Friday, July 7. “You are GLOWING and INSPIRING and HOT AF. A Mom. A boss. A star.”</p><p>Usher, 44, also replied to the post: “The Big Boss!! Thank U for coming 🙏🏾.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmaKewrR5yZqapKufo3q0scSmoKefnK56pbHLnqueq12gsqyxjKmYpaWVp3qxtM6tpqxlkaK2pXnBmpqkpJGotXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
