Nevertheless, she describes herself as a mom first on her Instagram bio before a dancer, so she certainly has her priorities straight.</p><p>That being said, she'll clearly do whatever it takes to win big in these ballroom dancing competitions. However, she has a lot of obstacles to deal with even outside of her familial duties as Kelvin's mom.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Her pro-dancer partner leaves her to in order to compete with Pooja Mehta, another Dancing Queens star.
