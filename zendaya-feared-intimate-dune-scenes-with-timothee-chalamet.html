It’s the one space in which I can feel safe being spontaneous, because I’m not myself; I’m someone else. There are no consequences.”</p><p>In Dune, Zendaya plays Chani, the mysterious figure who haunts the dreams of Paul Atreides (Chalamet), one of the aristocrats who have taken over governing the desert planet of Arrakis. Throughout the course of the film, Chani and Paul grow closer and fall in love.</p><p>Like their characters, the <a href=#>Malcolm and Marie</a> star and Chalamet, 26, quickly <a href=#>formed a tight bond</a>.</p><p>“I was the only other person closer to his age on the cast,” Zendaya told<a href=#> UK Vogue</a> in October 2021. “So he was like, ‘Awesome, someone who understands my jokes!’ He just rolled up with his little boom box [in my trailer],” she said recalling their on-set dance parties to “2000s dance songs like <a href=#><strong>Soulja Boy</strong></a>.”</p><p>“We got in a nice, beautiful rhythm, where we were able to snap into focus on scenes but we had so much fun, too,” Chalamet said at the time. “Especially in this industry, it’s nice to have other people who are going through it too and that you can talk to.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since filming wrapped on Dune, the pair have frequently gushed about <a href=#>their close friendship</a>, with Zendaya describing the Call Me By Your Name star as “like family” during an October 2021 interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>“Immediately I was like, ‘Oh, we’re going to be friends for life. Like, this is happening,'” the <a href=#>Shake It Off alum</a> recalled to <a href=#>E! News</a> later that month. “So that was great and I had an incredible time, and I sure hope that we get to do more of it because selfishly, I just want to have fun.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaLGeppSWxqJ5xZ6Yq52UYravwMimmK2dXZnCr7GMrJqeppWoeri106FkraGdpMGpscRmmqGZnJa6psCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
