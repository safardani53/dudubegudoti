The referee gave it, but the linesman has decided it was clear enough to not be a penalty.</p><p>"It's like human VAR, but with the actual <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VAR</a>, the only way they turn decisions, as you hear from the rules, is if it's a clear and obvious challenge. It wasn't - I can't understand it.</p><p>"I'm not standing here and saying it was a clear penalty; I've looked at it and it's probably right in the middle. Jayden Bogle has got his leg across, there's not huge contact, but enough that he's in front of him before he gets there.</p><p>"But for the linesman to decide by himself and for the referee to accept that decision, making him completely wrong, is really difficult to understand.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest EFL news</h2></p><p>"The linesman will say he thought it wasn't [clear], but the referee gave it, so work that one out."</p><p>Lampard will be desperate to get his revenge and the last laugh following the second leg at Elland Road - while Leeds fans will be relishing the chance to have 35,000 belting out the new song in unison.</p><p>Just whatever happens, Frank, don't look back in anger.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa admits to sending a spy to Derby County training ground</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX259doKUbWlopJWasbR5xZqlrGWTna6vwIylmKaokaexbr%2FPsp6arJVivKK%2FyKxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
