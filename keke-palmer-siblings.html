In a surprise appearance on her former talk show, GMA3: Strahan, Sarah, & Keke, the actress’s mom said she always volunteered to help with the twins when they were babies. Lawrencia and Lawrence also both agreed that Keke is “the coolest” big sister ever, which warmed the Nope star’s heart.</p><p>“I am so grateful for my family,” she declared on the show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Keke Palmer’s older sibling, Loreal "L.C."

However, that doesn’t mean the siblings don’t want their individual success.</p><p>In July 2022, Claim to Fame aired on ABC. The competition, co-hosted by <a href=#>Frankie Jonas</a> and <a href=#>Kevin Jonas</a>, introduced viewers to <a href=#>L.C.</a>, who stated in the series premiere that she’s a “relative” of an Emmy Award-winning actress.</p><p>L.C. kept fans guessing who her celebrity family member was each week. Meanwhile, Twitter users had already dug up some details regarding her identity. One user, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@LIVtheVirgo</a>, found old photos of a woman who looked a lot like L.C. posing next to Keke. L.C. also hinted at being related to Keke in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">episode 5</a>, “The Domfather,” when she wore a bee costume as one of the clues about her identity.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>The costume paid homage to Keke’s breakout film, <a href=#>Akeelah and the Bee</a>, starring Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett. L.C.’s fellow contestants initially thought the clue meant Laurence was the mystery relative. But, L.C. revealed in an Aug. 2, 2022 episode that her real name is Loreal, and she’s Keke’s older sister.</p><p>“My sister and I are extremely close,” Loreal said of Keke on the show, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>. “I feel like she is my biggest cheerleader.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Although Keke felt confident Loreal would win Claim to Fame, she revealed the one thing that could keep her from winning the $100,000 grand prize.</p><p>“She’s gonna have to keep her lips zipped,” Keke noted. “We have similar cadences; the Palmer cadence is what we call it. So hopefully, she doesn’t let it slip out. But I’m so excited for her! She’s a star.” Thankfully, Loreal was able to maintain her secrecy.</p><p>Loreal explained in a private interview that she went on Claim to Fame to boost her “self-confidence,” which Keke said she fully supports.</p><p>“I’m living for her being on Claim To Fame; I mean, she is giving her all,” Keke shared with ET. “I’m so proud of her. You know, everybody in my family is a real character, and obviously, she’s my older sister, so a lot of what you see and know of as me, I got from her. So I’m very excited.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKssYypmKWllad6tLXBpaCnn6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
