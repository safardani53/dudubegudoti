Sean has worked in many areas of the movie-making world, including development, production, post-production and marketing, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDB</a>. Although he didn’t follow his mother’s footsteps as an actor, he did take up her humanitarian spirit and founded the Audrey Hepburn Children’s Fund a year after she passed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In 2020, he published a children’s book with his wife <strong>Karin Ferrer</strong> called “Little Audrey’s Daydream” to introduce the story of his mother to a new generation. While promoting it, he revealed what he thought Audrey would say about the current fascination with Instagram. “People say to me, ‘What do you think your mother would think about this new world with Instagram?’ And I pause and I just say, ‘Well, she really was the queen of Instagram because she was more photographed than anyone else,” he explained on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sean has a daughter,<strong> Emma Ferrer</strong>, who has been in the public eye with some modeling gigs and interview.

He has three books on the subject of his famous mother under his belt: Audrey in Rome, Audrey at Home: Memories from my Mother’s Kitchen and Audrey mia Madre.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Even though he has written extensively on the Oscar winner, Luca said he didn’t know she was famous while he was growing up. “I didn’t realize until after her death she was such an icon,” he said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>This Morning</a> in 2015. “When she was alive she was always caring about her charities and us. There was a big gap between her private life and public life.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>“When I was growing up there were movie stars coming to the house all the time but we weren’t aware they were famous, when they came over they were just introduced as her friends,” he added. “It was only later that I found out Julie Andrews was Mary Poppins, or who were Roger Moore was, they were just her friends.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Luca is married to <strong>Domitilla Bertusi</strong>.

Disappearing from the fashion scene soon afterwards, Emma went about studying art and worked as a gallery liaison in 2018. “I’ve always wanted to be on the art-making side, but I am drawn to everything that happens on the other side,” she told the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Although she never met Audrey personally, Emma revealed how she came to know her grandmother was one of the most famous actresses of all time. “Growing up, there were these two things going on at the same time: There was the way that I got to know her, that everyone else got to know her—which was through her movies and the iconography of her and photos—and then there’s this way that I’ve gotten to know her really uniquely which is through my father,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar</a> in January. “Understanding her more and more is still a work in progress today. I think now I’ve understood the level of fame, which even that took me a long time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Cum6udqWK1przBrqmnZZOdtq2w0Z6lZp%2Bilrulr8eio52qlaN6dYGYbmhwbF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
