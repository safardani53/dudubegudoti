Red, white and green.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MARKS & SPENCER">READ MORE ON MARKS & SPENCER</h2><p>The colours of Christmas? Red, white and green. Quite.</p><p>As coincidences go, it’s unfortunate.</p><p>Not least because the ad was filmed in AUGUST...weeks before the first <a href=#>Hamas atrocity</a> on October 7.</p><p>But that wasn’t enough to placate the baying mob, and M&S — founded by an immigrant Jew who probably knew a thing or two about hardship — was duly forced to apologise and remove the offending clip.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Quite why M&S didn’t tell the lunatic critics to go shove their festive outrage up their parsons noses says everything you need to know about the pernicious state of cancel culture.</p><p>Of all the insane angry comments from shoppers following the retailer’s apology, which clarified that filming took place in the summer, were the ones that decried: “THEN WHY ARE YOU ONLY SHOWING THE AD NOW?”</p><p>Yeah, guys. Why didn’t you debut it on the hottest day of the year?</p><p>You insensitive Scrooges.</p><p>In an unprecedented <a href=#>cost-of-living crisis</a>, M&S has now been forced to pulp hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of ads in newspapers and mags.</p><p>The irony, of course, is that the ad was about celebrating the true meaning of Christmas — laughter, fun, family.</p><p>To do away with pomp and ceremony — a decorated loo roll is used as a tree fairy — and cherish love.</p><p>Nothing could be less loving than this hostile backlash.</p><p>Or more expensive if you’re the poor M&S art director.</p><p>Hamas, if not too busy slaughtering innocents, must think we’re more extremist than them.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company has been accused of insulting Christmas itself, with the ad showing celebrities destroying their least favourite parts of the festive season.</p><p>An inner-city headteacher called Katharine Birbalsingh wrote an open letter to the store, accusing them of putting “two fingers up” to traditional values.</p><p>“I feel compelled to write to you to express my deep disappointment and outrage at your Christmas advert for 2023,” she began, sounding very much like a woman who’s received a lot of coal in her stocking over the years.</p><p>Joylessly, she continued: “When Marks & Spencer puts two fingers up to these values it makes our lives as teachers much more difficult and it stifles social mobility.</p><p>“How can you do this to our country at this time?</p><p>“Shame on you.</p><p>“Please take the advert down.</p><p>“Try again. Do better.”</p><p>Quite how Ms Birbalsingh, billed as Britain’s toughest headteacher, finds the time to get so upset about a one minute 20 second advert, one featuring <a href=#>Elf On The Shelf</a> and <a href=#>Hannah Waddingham</a> from <a href=#>Ted Lasso</a>, is as baffling as it is ridiculous.</p><p>At a time when thousands are being killed, children and babies are being held hostage and murdered, and corresponding wars are occurring across this messed-up globe, why are we wasting our energy on this madness?</p><p>Where will it end?</p><p>Christmas cancelled because Santa is morbidly obese?</p><p>Prancer and Comet grounded because of intolerable working conditions?</p><p>No tinsel because, well, we know now red, green and white are colours of oppression.</p><p>These conspiracy theories would almost be funny...if they weren’t so terrifying.</p><p>SAD news for my friend, Simon, whose cat has been diagnosed with dementia.</p><p>Rosie, the 12-year-old feline, was shuffled off to the vet after displaying some angry, un-cat-like behaviour.</p><p>One £250 vet’s bill later, and off forgetful Rosie was packed with some over-priced Omega 3 supplements.</p><p>Which, one presumes, is like popping a plaster on a broken leg.</p><p>A £250 plaster.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">VAPE IS A RISK TO KIDS</h2><p>WITHOUT doubt, this will be the biggest health epidemic this government, and the next and the next, will ever face.</p><p>New stats show vapes have put <a href=#>two dozen under-tens in hospital</a> over the past two years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vape-teenager-young-pretty-white-838711162.jpg><p>Admission rates for “vaping-related disorders” in under-20s have also risen six-fold.</p><p>The other day, a boy of about 12 accosted me outside a newsagent and asked me to buy him a vape.</p><p>Obviously I refused.</p><p>I know first-hand how addictive these snazzily packed, hand-held fruit devices, crammed with nicotine, are.</p><p>My ex was a vape addict and, worryingly, for a while I got into them.
