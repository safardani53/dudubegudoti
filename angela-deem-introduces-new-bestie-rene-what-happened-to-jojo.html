But didn’t Angela film with another friend?</p><p>JoJo witnessed Angela’s 2020 wedding in Nigeria. She helped Angela recover from surgery in Vegas.</p><p>Where is she? What happened?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We will, of course, start with Rene Smith’s introduction to 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? viewers.</p><p>Angela Deem was busy packing her bags on Season 7, Episode 5.</p><p>This is when Rene entered the picture, appearing on camera to chat with Angela while she prepared to go see Michael.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Angela had married Michael in Nigeria two years prior, in February of 2020. She had not been back since.</p><p>This time, Rene will fly out with her on the trip. The two became friends after meeting in an airport.</p><p>Apparently, Angela smelled cigarette smoke on Rene and knew her to be a kindred spirit. Together, the two grossly violated airport rules by smoking together in a bathroom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Angela shared her upcoming wardrobe, including some (what we will generously call) “sexy” attire.</p><p>She explained how eager she was to flaunt her dramatic weight loss and impossible-to-miss body transformation.</p><p>Specifically, Angela wanted to impress Michael. She wants that man dickmatized by her new body. Because, over long distance, he has not acted impressed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Angela felt similarly unimpressed with Michael’s social media activity. Namely, that he had any.</p><p>Michael had told her that he was going to keep his Instagram up unless she paid him a $5,000 bribe.</p><p>Viewers are divided over whether this is money that she owes him or not. But no one thinks that this is a healthy marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Speaking of this marriage’s toxicity, Angela’s “visit” to Michael is actually more of an ambush.</p><p>She told Rene that he had no idea that she was flying out to catch him off guard.</p><p>Her plan, she explained, was to snatch his phone and read through it. Awful woman, awful marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Angela gloated to Rene that she had researched marriage laws in Nigeria.</p><p>She told her that, apparently, Michael’s property was also hers.</p><p>This means that Angela expected that she could snatch his phone, tow his car, or worse with total impunity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Brimming with ill intent, Angela boarded her flight and headed to Nigeria.</p><p>However, the preview for Season 7, Episode 6 showed Angela and Rene in Nigeria.</p><p>There, Angela harassed and taunted Michael before she began trashing his car. The violence, she hopes, will force him outside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>First up, who is Rene Smith?</p><p><a href=#>Starcasm reports</a> that she is the owner of D&R Barber & Nail Shop in Union City, California.</p><p>As she detailed to the camera, she and Angela met in an airport. Water finding its own level, apparently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But whatever happened to JoJo?</p><p>In 2020, she witnessed Angela’s wedding to Michael. She flew all the way out to Nigeria to do so.</p><p>Remember, at that time, not one member of Angela’s family was willing to do that much for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>JoJo did more than that.</p><p>When Angela began to undergo rounds of painful cosmetic procedures, JoJo accompanied her again.</p><p>This time, she flew out to see her in Vegas and stayed with her in her hotel to help her walk and eat during recovery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But late last year, <a href=#>Angela and JoJo had a nasty falling out</a>, with Angela screeching insults at her former friend.</p><p>What happened? Apparently, JoJo was too enthusiastic upon meeting Debbie Johnson, a better-liked 90 Day Fiance cast member.</p><p>Angela, driven by jealousy or whatever motivates her twisted mind, was furious. Their friendship is over. We’re glad that JoJo got out of that.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WGcK3NoJylmV2Zsqa5jKKlraqfmcKksdJmpZ6vXZeytMDInmSrnZ6aeri0wK1koZmgpbKvscNmq6hlmqS3sHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
