His influence on Mexican politics and government after independence in the first half of the 19th century was so much that Mexican historians often refer to it as "the age of Santa Anna." Santa Anna agrees with the important points of the Monroe Doctrine that European powers would not use the Gifts, Lords and Governorates as absent owners of their conquered lands in the Americas. He disagreed with the United States on slavery; but he did not agree to let the Africans enter his territory as freed slaves. He carried out cruel attacks on the Native American tribes of Mexican America. He was known as the "Man of Fate", who "stood out through his time as an ostentatious statue, a king without a crown". Santa Anna's military and political career has seen a series of reversals.</p><table class=wikibox readability=7><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>February 21, 1794, Xalapa, Veracruz, New Spain</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>June 21, 1876, Mexico City, Mexico</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Political party</td><td class=wk_value>Liberal</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Civilian awards</td><td class=wk_value>Order of Charles III, Order of Guadalupe</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Preceded by</td><td class=wk_value>Manuel María Lombardini</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Succeeded by</td><td class=wk_value>Martín Carrera</td></tr></table><p>World Leader Antonio López de Santa Anna was born in Mexico on February 21, 1794.
