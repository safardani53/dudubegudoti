Once the racer reaches the other side, teams need to correctly identify the Andalusian flag that was held by the tour guide when they arrived in Ronda.</p><p>Claire chose to do the task over her partner, boyfriend <strong>Derek Xiao</strong>, because “she has a great memory, which is part of why I was happy for her to do this one,” he explains. “But if you’re scared, your brain is not really working. Her memory might be little bit impeded because of that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Claire-Attempts-to-Conquer-Fear-of-Heights-on-%E2%80%98Amazing-Race-122.jpg><p>Prior to the season, the couple <a href=#>exclusively talked to Us</a> about how they “complement each other” and went into it acknowledging both their strengths and weaknesses. “The joke I always make was me and Claire only had one bag and I carried it,” Derek said at the time. “So I always told people, ‘I carried the bag, but Claire carried me.’ I think it was my physical endurance on some of the challenges. But then Claire has one of the best memories of anyone I know. She has great attention to detail and there are so many challenges where it literally is just attention to detail.”</p><p>While the New York native attempts to walk across the high wire in the clip, fellow racer <a href=#><strong>Aubrey Ares</strong></a>, who is also taking on the task, tries to encourage her.</p><p>“Please don’t talk to me, I’m sorry,” Claire tells Aubrey, who says, “Talking was actually helping me.”</p><p>“This is horrible. This is a mistake,” Claire later tells the cameras. “Right away, I was like, ‘Derek should have done this.’ I really don’t like heights. This has been my No. 1 fear since I was a child. I think this is one of the worst things I’ve ever done.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While viewers don’t know how it ends just yet, she continues to push through, all while saying, “I hate this, I hate this, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.”</p><p>The Amazing Race airs on CBS Wednesdays at 9:00 p.m.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqlmZmnsm6t062cpqikqHq1u4ycpqeppZq%2FbrLEmqlmp5Zitaa1xqGrrGWfo3qiucCzoKefXaeupLGMsJitm5hk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
