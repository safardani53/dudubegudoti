To get married in his dress was a dream come true."</p><p>Taika said of the low-key ceremony: "Just having close friends and not having it too big. We didn’t have table settings or any of the stressful things that go along with weddings, and it was nice to just have it super-simple. My daughters were there, and they made everything really fun and easy: I think just because we didn’t have the pressure of having caterers and all of these things, you know, people turning up late, and all of the different moving parts.”</p><p>After their vows the married couple went to mutual friend's, talent manager Guy O'Seary, house for their wedding breakfast.</p><p>The newlyweds were surprised by an Elvis impersonator and Rita even joined him for a sing song as they let their <span id=dcaa6f8a-b6eb-4e9a-b11d-5b19db2ce2bd class=suggested-link>hair</span> down and partied into the night.</p><p>In a departure from the traditional tiered wedding cake, the couple's one-tier effort read "we're married b***es!!!" in red icing.</p><p>We exclusively revealed the pair had married back in January and Rita went on to confirm the <span id=71ec43e1-2c6a-457f-9890-43d4c4b05d95 class=suggested-link>news</span> by announcing she was "off the market".</p><p>She said: "I chose to keep it more private and keep it to myself more but with my new video I am playing on what could have been.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"When the rumours came out is she, isn't she? I wanted to play on it. I wanted to do a wedding that didn't go to plan… that's not to say that is actually what happened."</p><p>Gushing over her special day, Rita said: "It was perfect. It was exactly, exactly how I wanted.</p><p>"It was nice and perfect. It is nice to keep some things just to myself sometimes it was nice and sweet… Sorry it's not that interesting. One day I will throw a big party."</p><p>Rita popped the question to Taika back in 2022, four years after the pair met at a barbecue, and the director responded with a swift 'yes'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jack-gorlin-rita-ora-behind-836205292.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jack-gorlin-rita-ora-behind-836205297.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jack-gorlin-rita-ora-behind-836205373.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZ2uFeYWWaKCnq5mZsm6%2ByK2YZqeilnqqusKrnJ2hkqGybr%2FEnKmerF2ssqWwyKeeaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
