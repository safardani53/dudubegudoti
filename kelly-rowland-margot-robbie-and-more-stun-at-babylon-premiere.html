The blunt ‘do, which featured wispy bangs, is reminiscent of the look she rocked during her <a href=#>Destiny’s Child</a> days. Along with her chopped crown, the “Motivation” singer stunned in a dramatic red gown by Iris Van Herpen. The floor-length number featured dainty fabric that looked like coral reefs draped across her body. The look was finished with a silky pleated skirt. For her glam, Rowland donned a shiny highlight, smoky eyes and a glossy nude lip.</p><p>Robbie, 32, who stars in the film — which follows the ups and downs of aspiring actors in Hollywood — went for a bold, skin-baring ensemble. She strutted her stuff in a cutout dress by Alaïa that was equipped with an opening at the bodice and an asymmetrical skirt. Her frock was finalized with a feather-adorned detail at the waist.</p><p>Wilde, 38, for her part, delivered drama in a black double-breasted blazer paired with a sheer dress. The <a href=#>Don’t Worry Darling</a> director added even more pizazz with heavy black eyeliner and a pair of sandal heels.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Elle Fanning</strong></a> was also in attendance in a figure-hugging silk dress from Alexander McQueen. She added a statement with a bright pink lip. <a href=#><strong>Rebecca Rittenhouse</strong></a>, meanwhile, looked like a Barbie in a crystal-covered design by Khoon Hooi.</p><p>In addition to Robbie, the film also stars Wilde, <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Tobey Maguire</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Max Minghella</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Chloe Fineman</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jean Smart</strong></a> and <strong>Samara Weaving</strong>.</p><p>Robbie opened up about the project, specifically filming with Pitt, 58, in an interview with <a href=#>E! News</a> earlier this month, explaining she suggested that she and the Oscar winner<a href=#> kiss</a>.</p><p>“That wasn’t in the script,” the Barbie actress said of the onscreen smooch on December 5. “But I thought, ‘When else am I gonna get the chance to kiss Brad Pitt? I’m just gonna go for it.’” She continued: “I said, ‘Damien, I think Nellie would just go up and kiss Jack.’”</p><p>The Australia native added: “And [our director] Damien was like, ‘Well, she could — wait, hold on. You just wanna kiss Brad Pitt.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, so sue me. This opportunity might never come up again.’ And he was like, ‘It does work for the character,’ and I was like, ‘I think so.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Babylon is set to hit theaters on December 23.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the best red carpet moments from the premiere:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKnqOlsV2nvLi4wKebZqWRp7SwwIyrppuamZp6orrDZqSoqpViwLXBzWaYrWWSlq%2B6uM6nZKmqlaK2pr7EaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
