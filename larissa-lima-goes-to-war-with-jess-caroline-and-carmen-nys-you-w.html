Jess found, fell in love with, and married Brian Hanvey.</p><p>There was an incident in Vegas (we will explain below) that caused their friendship to sour.</p><p>But when Larissa and Jess had a falling out, it wasn’t a simple case of drifting apart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>A couple of months ago, Brian released a diss track … about Larissa.</p><p>Larissa is a very polarizing reality star and is no stranger to criticism, including those from ex-friends.</p><p>But what really struck a nerve was that the diss track mentioned Larissa’s children back in Brazil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Larissa is waging all-out war against Jess and against her other former friend, Carmen Nys.</p><p>She wishes that Jess wouldn’t involve or even mention Larissa’s children in her feud.</p><p>Larissa misses them but cannot currently visit them, as they are back in Brazil. It’s a very delicate subject.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Larissa also taunted Jess, saying that she had simply married the first guy she could.</p><p>According to Larissa, Jess is living in a sub-par apartment with "cockroaches."</p><p>It is unclear if she is claiming that Jess is a literal infestation victim or if Larissa is just super mad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Larissa also shot down the claim that Jess was fired from her au pair job from dating Colt.</p><p>Instead, Larissa says that Jess was fired because the family for whom she was working didn’t want to be associated with 90 Day Fiance.</p><p>Larissa once again suggests that Jess rushed to get married in order to avoid deportation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Larissa also accused Jess of having shared Colt’s nude photos and videos.</p><p>Jess had of course accused Colt of the same, and Larissa had echoed her revenge porn accusations.</p><p>Larissa said that it was hypocritical of Jess to allegedly do the same to Colt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Larissa’s ex-friend Carmen Nys has appeared on 90 Day Fiance.</p><p>For months, Larissa lived with Carmen, who disapproved of her relationship with Eric.</p><p>Carmen was there for her when she needed her, Larissa got her on TV, and they had a fast friendship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Or so we thought.</p><p>Carmen ended up promoting Brian’s diss track of Larissa.</p><p>Furiously, Larissa is calling out Carmen, sharing that many things that Carmen did were not the actions of a friend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Larissa (posting from a side account that she created to wage this wear) accused Carmen of sabotaging her.</p><p>Specifically, she claimed that Carmen threw Larissa’s binder of important immigration documents away.</p><p>That is horrifying if it is true. No amount of anger or anything else should drive someone to destroy another’s life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When Carmen accused Larissa of lashing out just to stay relevant, Larissa fired back.</p><p>She said that Carmen is the one who uses her for fame and name recognition, not the other way around.</p><p>Larissa accused Carmen of rampant dishonesty and advised her to "stay in your lane."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Speaking to 90 Day Fiance blogger John Yates, Larissa and Nathalie (remember the girl Eric flirted with in Colorado?) spoke out.</p><p>There, it was explained that Larissa’s bad blood with Carmen and Jess truly was born when both seemed to ghost her after her surgery in Vegas.</p><p>She didn’t get the ride home from her friends that she hoped for, and it sounds like this caused her to reevaluate where things stood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Obviously, there is more to this than just some simple hurt feelings.</p><p>And Larissa, Jess, and Carmen are all known to have strong, arguably volatile moods and emotions, which is not helping things.</p><p>It’s sad, because so many fans would like to see these rifts mended — and possibly even friendships restored.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Unfortunately, on Thursday night, Larissa took to her Instagram Stories to share that she was visiting the local police.</p><p>We hesitate to even try to guess what this is about, but since she showed it, one wonders if she was threeatened or harassed.</p><p>We hope that everyone remains safe. No feud is worth criminal threats, let alone follow-through.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WCcLjAq6Csq5Fiuaq5wGaeqJ2jYsGwedaaqWavmam1brbErKpmm5GnvK21zZ5kmqaUYrCivsyepWamqah6urvUZq5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
