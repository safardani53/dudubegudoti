After the initial “shock” of the change wore off, Motsepe was ready to welcome the <a href=#>America’s Next Top Model</a> alum with open arms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Keo-Motsepe-Thinks-Tyra-Banks-Did-a-Good-Job-Hosting-DWTS.jpg><p>“You have to give that person the same energy that you gave the last person,” the South Africa native told Us. “Dancing With the Stars is not — I always say this — it’s not about one person. It’s a production. There’s so many people that are behind-the-scenes that people don’t know about. … We all come together and that’s what people get to see every night.”</p><p>When season 29 of DWTS kicked off last fall, some episodes didn’t go so smoothly for Banks. The Daytime Emmy winner suffered a <a href=#>wardrobe malfunction</a> and even misread one couple’s <a href=#>elimination results</a>, leading some fans to wish Bergeron, 65, and Andrews, 42, would return to the ballroom. However, Motsepe thinks Banks deserves a little more credit. (The network later revealed that they printed the wrong name; Banks didn’t misread.)</p><p>“[It was] her first season. She did a good job, you know, and I think people at home have to allow the change,” he said on Thursday. “They should be open to a different judge, a different host, a different dance. … It’s hard sometimes when there’s a change because you’re used to one thing, but I think change is always good.”</p><p>Banks <a href=#>owned up to making mistakes</a> during her first few episodes last season, telling Us exclusively in September that it’s “normal” to flub every now and then.</p><p>“If I didn’t want to mess up, if I wanted to be perfect, <a href=#>I know how to do that</a>,” the True Beauty creator said at the time. “There’s a very clear way as a host that you just read the words and you’re perfect and you know exactly how to do that. But when you’re relaxed and you keep it real, the mess-ups happen. … It’s live, and it’s real. It’s better than being like a doll.”</p><p>ABC confirmed on Tuesday, March 30, that Banks is <a href=#>expected to return</a> for season 30 later this year, along with longtime judges <a href=#><strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Len Goodman</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Bruno Tonioli</strong></a>.<a href=#><strong> Derek Hough</strong></a>, who was a pro partner on the series from 2007 to 2016, will also take a seat at the judges’ table after stepping in for Goodman, 76, for season 29, when he was unable to be there in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>While no celeb competitors have been announced just yet — and many DWTS pros aren’t sure if they’ll be asked back this fall — Motsepe has high hopes for who he’ll see in the ballroom.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s season 30, they should have A-list [stars]. I feel like they should have been <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong> </a>or <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>, you know, maybe <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a>,” he told Us, noting that his dream partner is <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a>. “Maybe next season.
