He began the apology by explaining why he believed it was the correct thing to do:</p><p>‚ÄúI felt that was the appropriate thing to do, so I went out first. Because I was scared, I expected to speak incoherently, so I jotted this down. With open hearts, I hope you may comprehend.‚Äù</p><p>The press conference is also his first formal public appearance since the issue. In October 2021, shortly after the season finale of Hometown Cha Cha Cha, an unidentified netizen claiming to be the actor‚Äôs ex-partner posted to a Korean online forum to accuse Kim Seon-ho of forcing her to have an abortion. The long-running debate was ultimately put to rest when the Korean news agency Dispatch refuted some of the ex-claims.&nbsp;Despite the positive conclusion, the Start-Up actor chose to withdraw from public life, saying goodbye to various projects, much to the chagrin of his admirers. He has just recently begun accepting new projects, the most recent being the play Touching the Void.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kim-Seon-Ho-2.jpg alt="Kim Seon-Ho" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Kim Seon-ho read a handwritten message At the press gathering for Touching the Void</h2><p>On July 20, the actor spoke to a packed house of media at Seoul‚Äôs Daehangno Art One Theater Hall in Jongno-gu.&nbsp;Kim Seon-ho, who stepped down from multiple projects in the midst of the scandal, read a handwritten note before the conference. He started by saying:</p><p>‚ÄúI really apologize for bringing this up at the press conference. From spring through summer, many individuals worked tirelessly to bring this production to life. I feel like I‚Äôve hampered everyone, so please accept my sincere apologies to the team and everyone.‚Äù</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Kim Seonho crying at the press call while apologizing for his controversy where he HAD NO FAULT makes me SO sad.
