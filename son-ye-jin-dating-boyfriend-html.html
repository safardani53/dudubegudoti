The actress's agency, MS Team Entertainment, also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">acknowledged</a> the revelation with a similar affirmation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The two built a friendship through their work, and after their drama ended, they started to meet each other with good feelings, and developed into a relationship. Please look upon them warmly and support them so they can continue meeting each other well.</p><p>Moreover,&nbsp;Ye-jin also quickly took to Instagram and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">expressed</a>&nbsp;that she was grateful for having such a nice person in her life. Furthermore, she assured fans that she would make efforts to nurture their relationship into something beautiful. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Crossed Paths Multiple Times In The Past</h2><p>Many first spotted the "RiRi" pair in the&nbsp;2019 drama series&nbsp;Crash Landing On You, and that made fans believe that Ye-jin and&nbsp;Bin were pairing up for the first time. But the truth is the couple&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">crossed</a>&nbsp;each other's paths way before their latest drama.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The two&nbsp;first crossed&nbsp;paths in 2011 when&nbsp;Ye-jin made a cameo in Bin’s hit drama,&nbsp;Secret Garden. However,&nbsp;they did not meet in person at that time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A few years later, in 2014, the K-town actors attended&nbsp;the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival and coincidentally sat next to each other. At the event,&nbsp;both of them received the 'Producers’ Choice Award.'</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The two&nbsp;finally worked together in 2017 when they shared a screen&nbsp;for&nbsp;the movie,&nbsp;The&nbsp;Negotiation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>My first impression of [Hyun Bin] was that he had really great skin and hair, and I thought he must be an actor that actresses are really into.</p><p>In September 2018, the film received&nbsp;a good reception, especially for&nbsp;Ye-jin and&nbsp;Bin's&nbsp;on-screen chemistry. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>A year later, the two came back with another drama series,&nbsp;Crash Landing On You. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><h2>Seems like She Has Found Her Good Match</h2><p>Before Ye-jin started her relationship with&nbsp;Memories of the Alhambra actor, the actress had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">expressed</a> in an interview in March 2018 that she was bad at dating. Because of this, she was single at that time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She further mentioned that one&nbsp;needs to have a certain mindset if they are to&nbsp;date someone—and she didn't prefer that idea much. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In order to date, you need to make up your mind to date, meet many people, and have blind dates offered to you, but that’s not easy. It’s more&nbsp;difficult as you get older. I don’t think it’s possible to do something by force either.</p><p>However, the actress was hopeful of finding a good match someday.&nbsp;Now, it seems like Ye-jin has found her match in her boyfriend, as they take their newly announced relationship&nbsp;ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlno6S7bsXEZqGipl2ZrrW1zaBkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dZaGsnaE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
