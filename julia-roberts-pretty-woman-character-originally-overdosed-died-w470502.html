By the way, in the original version — it’s pretty dark — I think she died of an overdose.”</p><p>The film studio executive, 66, explained that Disney wasn’t thrilled with the grim ending — for obvious reasons. “Convincing [people] that we should make that at the Walt Disney Co., and that it’s a fairy tale and a princess movie, a lot of people had a hard time seeing it,” he said. “But, as they say, the rest is history.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>It’s no secret that the original screenplay for <i>Pretty Woman</i> had to be rewritten into the romantic comedy that we all know and love today. In March 2015, screenwriter <b>J.F. Lawton</b> opened up about the Garry Marshall–directed movie’s once-dark ending during an interview with <i><a href=#>Vanity Fair</a></i>.</p><p>“If I had written the final draft, or somebody else had written the final draft, I don’t think it ever would have gotten produced,” Lawton, 56, told the publication. “I think it got produced because the original script had gone to Sundance, it was prestigious, it was viewed as serious art, so it was allowed to touch into this area of sexuality and money and prostitution and all of that. It gave Hollywood permission to do it, and then Garry was smart enough, because he’s got incredible pop instincts, to say, ‘OK, this is what people want to see, they want to see the fairy tale.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the end, <i>Pretty Woman</i> turned out to be a huge success (and made Roberts a superstar) and remains Disney’s highest grossing R-rated film to date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGupJmWerO7wZ6pratdpb%2BmwNOyZLCnnZa7bq%2FHmqmam6Sav2670aKeoqaRobm6ec6vnKucn6iypXnDopydZadphHGBj2tm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
