I hope he never walks again.</p><p>“I didn’t even know he had been released but it looks like he’s been up to no good from the minute he got out.”</p><p>Marian was shot in the chest protecting her daughter Xanthe, who was serving in the shop when the masked raiders attacked.</p><p>Police in Spain and the Foreign Office have now confirmed Moran was stabbed, shot and tortured before being dumped in a ditch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004335367061.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000000054004.jpg><p>Police are understood to be hunting a gang of three to four other Brits who are believed responsible for torturing Moran, which included&nbsp;<a href=#>cutting the tendons in his right hand, slashing him from ear to ear</a>, and shooting him in both legs.</p><p>The horror attack is believed to be linked to a drug deal.</p><p>Speaking after the attack in Spain, Victor Bates told how the loss of his wife in the robbery 15 years ago devastated his life.</p><p>He said: “Marian and I were together from the age of 16.

I often think ‘what’s the point?’ because I have nobody to please now.”</p><p>Moran was 22 when he was jailed alongside Peter Williams, then 19, and Dean Betton, then 23, for the fatal robbery.</p><p>Marion’s daughter Xanthe Kirkland-Bates, 49, now runs a shop selling log-burners and stoves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433852330.jpg><p>Speaking to Sun Online at the shop she said: “Perhaps people are trying to get rid of Moran over what happened. Perhaps it’s something unconnected.</p><p>“They ruined my father’s life. The day I&nbsp; lost my mum was the day I also lost my dad. They broke him - he has never been the same person since.</p><p>“He can’t talk about my mum without bursting into tears, even now. Those people took his life away.</p><p>“You can get over a death if it’s natural, or even if it’s a car accident, or something like that. But you can’t when someone murders your mum.</p><p>“We were normal people going about our daily lives, we had nothing to do with the strain of life Moran and his mates came from.”</p><p>Kirkland-Bates spent 11 years working in a call centre following the shooting horror before opening Village Stoves, in Rainworth, a year ago.</p><p>“I felt totally secure because I zapped in and zapped out.
