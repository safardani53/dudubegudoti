Last week, the reality personality married her longtime boyfriend Doug Fillmore on the Caribbean shore.&nbsp;The pair married in a small ceremony at Belmond Cap Juluca, a Belmond hotel on the island of Anguilla. The newlyweds made the news on Instagram. Seinne Fleming and Doug Fillmore of The Bachelor had a “civil ceremony and celebration in Los Angeles a few weeks earlier” to their “symbolic ceremony.” Last year, the pair confirmed their engagement.</p><h2>Doug Fillmore, the spouse of The Bachelor alum Seinne Fleming, is a real estate agent.</h2><p>Doug, Seinne’s fiancé, graduated from Swinburne University of Technology with a BBA, Marketing, and International Business degree. According to his LinkedIn page, he even attended the University of Cincinnati. Doug began his career in 2014 as a Talent Acquisition Manager at Nestlé. As a Senior Marketing Operations Specialist, he departed the company in 2019. He later worked as a Director for Zacuto Group, a commercial real estate agency in Santa Monica, California, where he is now a Vice President. Seinne made her debut on Arie Luyendyk Jr.’s season of The Bachelor. She began dating fellow real estate agent Doug in 2018 after her eviction.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Seinne-Fleming-1.jpg alt="Seinne Fleming" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Seinne and Doug announced their engagement in August 2021 after dating for three years. Doug arranged the whole surprise and proposed to Seinne in Malibu. Seinne said at the time:</p><p>“It began with a helicopter trip over Los Angeles, landing on a hilltop in Malibu for the real moment, followed by a surprise supper with 20 close friends and family at the Merois rooftop restaurant at the Pendry West Hollywood. I knew it would be a great moment in our lives when it occurred, but there’s nothing I’ve ever been more certain of in my life than spending it with him.”</p><p>According to Us Weekly, Seinne walked down the aisle in a long flowing, backless gown with twin chiffon trains by Mônot, “which is a very new brand by designer Eli Mizrahi.” She stated:</p><p>“I wanted to wear a garment that would naturally compliment the Moroccan architecture of Cap Juluca and the effortless background of the immaculate beach,” says the designer.</p><p>Meanwhile, the groom donned a Suit Supply brown suit with a dark striped tie. They had their legal ceremony in front of friends and family in Los Angeles the month prior, so their Anguilla beach nuptial ceremony was just the two of them. Sienne told us about The Bachelor:</p><p>“After months of considering several wedding choices ranging from large to tiny, we eventually decided on an intimate beach ceremony with just the two of us!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Seinne-Fleming-2.jpg alt="Seinne Fleming" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite the fact that it was only the two of them, their wedding had “many of the components of a conventional wedding.” The couple even cut their wedding cake on the beach. The newlyweds’ favorite part of the ceremony was “exchanging vows on the sand,” with the sounds of the waves and a local musician performing in the backdrop, as they “reflected on our love and made pledges for our future.”&nbsp;Several Bachelor Nation alums wished the couple well on their wedding posts. Seinne and Doug, as husband and wife, are now “looking forward to continuing to construct” their lives together as a “family.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroZ1dl66ktMSlpqtlo6mus3nSnqCnppVis62xzKKloGWXpMFuucCrqaKdlGLBsHnHnqlmpJ%2BjtG7AyKacZpqfrrOztcSnm2acn6q0brLIpaOmp6KafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
