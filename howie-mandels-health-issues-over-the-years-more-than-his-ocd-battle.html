(If one’s OCD focuses on contamination or germs, as in the Bobby’s World creator’s case, they may obsessively wash their hands countless times until raw.) For Mandel, he copes with his OCD by shaving his head and greeting people with his now-iconic fist-bump.</p><p>“In my mind, this is a Petri dish,” the “Howie Mandel Does Stuff” podcast host told <a href=#>20/20</a> in 2009, showing his hand, palm up, to the camera. “Otherwise, I would have spent days, as I have in the past, in the men’s room, rubbing and scrubbing and scalding.”</p><p>Though it’s been difficult for him at times to be so open about his OCD, Mandel wrote a book about his struggles, titled Here’s the Deal: Don’t Touch Me, which was released in 2009. He peppered the autobiography with his trademark humor while discussing his lifelong battle with mental health.</p><p>In addition to the psychological obstacles the comedian has coped with and continues to, he has also had his fair share of physical problems as well.</p><p>In October 2021, Mandel made headlines when he was rushed to the hospital after <a href=#>fainting at Starbucks</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I am home and doing better. I was dehydrated and had low blood sugar,” he wrote via Twitter at the time. “I appreciate the great doctors and nurses that took such good care of me. Thank you to everyone who reached out but I am doing OK!”</p><p>Keep reading to find out more about Mandel’s health issues over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktbDDyJ5kppmembKtv4yhnJqkpJ16qr%2FSrpysZZ%2BrsrN506GcZrGVlr%2B0ecyoqZ5lpJ2ur3nHoqpmp5OZeqOt062jnmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
