Despite their split, the former spouses have attempted to be cordial for <a href=#>sons Mason and Jake</a>, born in 2003 and 2007 respectively.</p><p>“Eddie’s going to be in my life for the rest of my life. We bicker still like we’re married when we’re not,” Glanville said during a June 2021 appearance on the <a href=#>“Hollywood Raw”</a> podcast while discussing where she stands with the&nbsp;<i>Sunset Beach&nbsp;</i>alum and Rimes, whom <a href=#>he wed in April 2011</a>. “We’re like sister wives. <a href=#>It’s me and LeAnn and Eddie.</a>”</p><p>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>&nbsp;</i>alum didn’t always have such fond feelings for Cibrian and the country star, however. In July 2009, Glanville had strong words about Rimes while announcing her separation from the&nbsp;<i>Best Man Holiday&nbsp;</i>actor.</p><p>“Eddie and I have decided to take some time apart,” the&nbsp;<i>Drinking and Dating&nbsp;</i>author exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>at the time. “I want to <a href=#>do what is best for our children</a>. Eddie and LeAnn deserve each other.”</p><p>The exes <a href=#>finalized their divorce in September 2010</a>.&nbsp;In the aftermath of the split, the “Brandi Glanville Unfiltered” podcaster confessed that she was most hurt by <a href=#>seeing her sons bonding with their new stepmom</a>.</p><p>“It’s the worst pain you could ever imagine,” the California native told<a href=#><strong> Bethenny Frankel</strong></a> on <a href=#>a September 2013 episode of&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Bethenny</a>.&nbsp;</i>“You think your heart is broken after you get a divorce? Wait until there is a girl tweeting pictures of, ‘Oh, look at my family.’ You have no idea.”</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Celebrity Big Brother&nbsp;</i></a>alum continued: “I feel like she almost does it to antagonize me, but <a href=#>at this point I’ve accepted it</a>. It took me a while, but Xanax was my friend when that started happening. I was like, ‘You can have the man, but those are my babies.'”</p><p>Despite her feelings toward Rimes, Glanville admitted that s<a href=#>he’d seen a positive change in her ex-husband</a> since their breakup.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You know, I think he’s actually become a much better father through divorce,” she said at the time. “Because when we were together, he wasn’t home a lot, he<a href=#> didn’t spend a ton of time with the kids</a>, and now he’s really present. That’s the one positive I take away from it because the rest freaking sucks.”</p><p>Scroll through for a look at Glanville and Cibrian’s relationship over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7OtzZ2gZp%2Bclru3tculnGadqGKypbDInmScoZKntqK60mapnqSRqbawutKhoKllpJ66prjIp5xo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
