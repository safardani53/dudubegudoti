This is where The Family Chantel now live.</p><p>Their exact location of their homes in Atlanta is unknown to the public, and it‚Äôs probably for the best that this has been kept a secret from the public to avoid fans turning up at their homes.</p><p>Last month, fans of the show found out where River Everett had moved to and approached him outside his home. Just after this, River went live on Instagram to vent about the situation, as he wants this part of his life to be kept private.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ‚ÄúRiverknight‚Äù (@iamriverknight)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=chantel-everetts-net-worth-explored>Chantel Everett‚Äôs net worth explored</h2><p>Due to her rise in fame from reality TV shows such as 90 Day Fianc√© and The Family Chantel, it‚Äôs no surprise that Chantel Everett‚Äôs net worth is ever-growing. In 2021, her net worth is estimated at around $1.5 million.</p><p>Her high fortune isn‚Äôt clearly evident in her Instagram posts, as she doesn‚Äôt flaunt her money by wearing designer clothes and items.
