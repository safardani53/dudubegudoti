According to Cheri McMaster, P&G’s spokesman, in a statement to Time:</p><p>“Retail sales have skyrocketed.”</p><p>McMaster also said that since the Trainwreck actress supported the items, demand has climbed by 7.7 percent. Amy Schumer is being blamed for a tampon shortage in the United States.</p><h2>Amy Schumer appeared in the brand’s Time to Tampax campaign.</h2><p>The corporation said that sales had increased since the advertisement began running. It was said,</p><p>“In the most recent quarter, the firm reported its largest sales to boost in decades, and the amount of money it generated from sales in its feminine care segment increased by 10%.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Amy-Schumer-2.jpg alt="Amy Schumer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, it seems that P&G is unable to meet increased demand since the product is in low supply throughout the nation. McMaster stated that the company was working 24 hours a day to meet up with demand.&nbsp;Amy Schumer appeared in a commercial for Tampax in 2020. The advertising centered on discussions about menstruation and tampons. Several videos starring the Snatched actress have been published by the company. It went on to say:</p><p>“When we decided to concentrate on tampons and period education, we felt Amy Schumer would be an excellent choice since Amy doesn’t back down from anything.”</p><p>The infomercial’s purpose, according to the business, was “to make period and tampon talks as normal as menstruation.” Schumer did not comment to Time at first, but subsequently responded on Instagram, exclaiming:</p><p>“Wait a minute, I don’t even have a uterus.”</p><p>To cure endometriosis, a painful uterine illness, the actress had a hysterectomy and an appendectomy.</p><h2>The Tampax tampon shortage is not unique.</h2><p>The nation is experiencing a tampon scarcity across several brands that do not have Amy Schumer endorsing them. The scarcity may be ascribed to the COVID-19. The pandemic has resulted in industrial closures and employee shortages, which may be the cause of a stretched supply chain. Furthermore, raw materials such as cotton, plastic, and paper pulp have been in short supply since they are also required to make face masks.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Amy-Schumer-3.jpg alt="Amy Schumer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Because of the scarcity, supermarket shops are running out of women’s hygiene goods. Meanwhile, Amazon vendors are capitalizing on the problem by offering a package of 18 Tampax for $114 (approximately $6 more per tampon than women typically spend).&nbsp;Several ladies have expressed their dissatisfaction on social media. A Reddit user said that she had to visit eight shops before finding her favored brand. RJ Michelle Wolfe stated:</p><p>“To put it plainly, tampons are almost difficult to come by; I’d say this has been the case for at least six months.”</p><p>Donated tampons have also decreased significantly for organizations that assist impoverished women with period supplies. Dana Marlowe, the creator of I Support the Girls, which supplies bras and menstrual hygiene to homeless women, said that their warehouses are almost depleted of period products. She revealed:</p><p>“For the last several months, groups have called us and said, ‘We need tampons,’ and when we get to our warehouse, there are none.”</p><p></p><p>Marlowe said that her organization has experienced a 61 percent decrease in tampon contributions compared to 2020. Other items, such as menstruation pads, are not suffering from a comparable scarcity.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYprFdqLCpwcyeqWaho2KvprXNoGShnZyZerOx0qmmp6uZl7mmecWoqWaZXamurrzOp2SsoJ%2BnwaKzxGagp2WknbJuwdJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
