This show would not have happened had we not had some absolutely savage dogs pulling this sled,” the St. Louis, Missouri, native, 28, wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on February 8, teasing the upcoming series. “It was an honor tearing through the snow with y’all.”</p><p class=p1>Basso portrays Peter Sutherland on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Night Agent</i>, which <a href=#>premieres on the streaming platform on Thursday, March 23</a>. The action-packed drama is <a href=#>adapted from <strong>Matthew Quirk</strong>’s novel</a> of the same name and&nbsp;follows Peter, who is an entry-level&nbsp;federal agent, while he works in the basement of the White House. Basso’s character is tasked with manning a phone that never rings&nbsp;— until it does&nbsp;— and unraveling a&nbsp;fast-moving and dangerous conspiracy that <a href=#>leads to the Oval Office</a>.</p><p class=p1>While few details about the&nbsp;<i>Hillbilly Elegy&nbsp;</i>star’s thrilling show have been shared, Basso has teased his action-packed experience.</p><p class=p1>“Yes, I actually stood up and offered that woman my seat.<a href=#> I do my own stunts</a>,” he jokingly wrote via Instagram Story on Thursday, March 9, referring to <i>The Night Agent</i>’s official trailer when he gave us his seat on a bus to a woman carrying a bag of groceries.</p><p></p><p class=p1>Basso initially rose to fame playing son Adam Jamison on Showtime’s&nbsp;<i>The Big C</i>.</p><p class=p1>“I didn’t want to be an actor originally, I wanted to be a professional football player, and I still sort of do. I started on a show called&nbsp;<i>The Big C</i>&nbsp;which ran on Showtime for four years,” the&nbsp;<i>Super 8&nbsp;</i>actor recalled to&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Hero Magazine</a>&nbsp;</i>in 2015. “Cancer has affected my family in a lot of ways. In terms of the show, the writers made it easier to deal with such a hard subject matter, plus <a href=#><strong>Laura [Linney]</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Oliver [Platt]</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>John [Benjamin Hickey]</strong></a>. I’ve been<a href=#> blessed enough to be surrounded by good people</a> in my life both on and off screen, like my parents and my friends, and it’s been a real pleasure being involved with the projects that I have because everyone has been awesome to work with.”</p><p class=p1>After the&nbsp;<i>C Word&nbsp;</i>wrapped, Basso continued acting and landed roles in&nbsp;<i>The Kings of Summer, Hillbilly Elegy&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Barely Lethal.&nbsp;</i>While the aspiring musician has enjoyed flexing his acting skills through the years, <a href=#>his No. 1 job is as a father</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I just had a little girl, so that’s my focus right now,” Basso revealed to St. Louis’ <a href=#>KSDK</a> during a November 2020 interview. “I am drumming a lot. This <a href=#>COVID thing</a> has limited options at the moment. I’d love a job, but it’s not really up to me.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to get to know the actor:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BptaZ5zaKeoaxdlrSmutOsZKCZkqe2priMm5isq59igm7Ax6KloKtdqbxut82ormg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
