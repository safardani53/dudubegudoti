In response, McCune created a separate Discord channel with personally-picked members to discuss the matter.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Here, McCune calls the transgender girl "a F-- posing as a girl in the discord," followed by a scheme to steal an item from the girl in RuneScape and split the profit between them.</p><p>The video also reveals McCune sold his girlfriend's nudes post-surgery for breast implants without consent for 15m RuneScape gold a piece. Discovering what occurred made her fearful of revenge porn from those she doesn't know in the community.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>McCune has claimed everything in the video is fake despite the landslide of evidence and screenshotted posts on Discord saying otherwise. There was even evidence of McCune frequently using racial slurs.</p><p>"This is actually disturbing. Those people should be in jail...what the actual f--k," said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one Reddit user</a> responding to the video.</p><p>The accusations against McCune never sparked movement from Jagex, however. For a while, no one knew if proper actions against the player would even happen.</p><p>That is, until Feb. 13, when a video published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Friend</a> on YouTube reignited controversy surrounding McCune.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Big respect to Dovydas.<br>Mine and Mccune’s interactions were only Runescape related.
