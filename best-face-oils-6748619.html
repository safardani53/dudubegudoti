But these days, oil is no longer thought of as something that needs to be removed from your skin — rather, it’s something to add in the quest for a radiant, glowy complexion. (Think that coveted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hailey Beiber glazed donut</a> look.) Enter the onslaught of face oils on the market. “The greatest benefit of using a face oil is deep skin nourishment. Most face oils contain omega fatty acids, which are essential for maintaining healthy, balanced, hydrated skin,” explains board-certified dermatologist Dr. Geeta Yadav.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one caveat? Not all oils are created equal. While some oils can actually help to regulate oil production in your skin, a good thing for those who are oily or even acne-prone, there are others that are comedogenic and can potentially clog pores, notes New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Hadley King. (TL;DR: It’s important to choose the right face oil for your skin type, as well as your particular complexion concerns.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To make that process easier, we put 36 face oils to the test, evaluating their consistency, absorption, and how they made our skin look. At the end of the day, we ended up with 11 options that earned our PEOPLE TESTED seal of approval, offering a little something for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to learn more about the best face oils that PEOPLE tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-acure-radically-rejuvenating-rose-argan-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Acure Radically Rejuvenating Rose Argan Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Acure Radically Rejuvenating Rose Argan Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/68AYv4lJIG-NSYCm4h7b9-S732s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ACURE-Radically-Rejuvenating-Rose-Argan-Oil-341726f85a1d47488320839607f49831.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Glow</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2.5><li readability=0><p>Extremely affordable and offers a variety of benefits, giving you even more bang for your buck</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Beneficial for all skin types and safe for sensitive skin</p></li><li readability=0><p>During testing, we saw a reduction in the appearance of fine lines</p></li><li readability=0><p>Got rid of our dry patches with continued use, even in the dead of winter</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested a variety of face oils at a variety of price points, but none performed quite as well as this budget-friendly option, which rings in at less than 10 dollars and scored perfect marks in every testing category. The value aspect aside, this formula relies on argan oil (which Dr. King points out is non-comedogenic) and rose oil. The combination delivers a hefty dose of antioxidant-rich vitamin E, along with tons of fatty acids that offer a mega hit of moisture.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To that point, it’s definitely a thick, rich oil, but there’s no need to stress about it being greasy. We found the formula to feel emollient and silky, lauding it for how quickly our previously dry skin absorbed it without leaving behind any residue. Surprisingly, we even saw a reduction in the appearance of our fine lines, which is always a win in our book. If you’re looking for a do-it-all face oil that won’t break the bank, this is absolutely it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>Even after six months of owning this oil, we still find ourselves routinely (and confidently!) reaching for it. With the change of the seasons we’ve been applying the oil to different spots, such as just our cheeks instead of our T-zones in warmer weather, or all over our faces during the dead of winter. Not only have we noticed a complete decline in our weather-dependent dry patches, but we’ve noticed how much more flawlessly our makeup glides onto our skin now that we’ve fully incorporated this oil into our routine. 10/10!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Oils: </strong>Argan, rose | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Hydration, anti-aging | <strong>Size:</strong> 1 oz.<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3040 data-sizes=750px alt="Bottle of Acure Radically Rejuvenating Rose Argan Oil laying on its side" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ae9TfkKow_4Q5gxX2_EP9Dkvh5A=/fit-in/1500x3040/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_ACURE_RadicallyRejuvenatingRoseArganOil-jthompson-0670-1b72101561664769943ca7ea50ca2db4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person putting Acure Radically Rejuvenating Rose Argan Oil on their cheek" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/lQrDA8TlFFnE4Dx6pemhkrEFXdo=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/face-oils-test-acure-radically-rejuvenating-rose-argan-jthompson-2070-9f7dfae435384b828f6ea206c6486f44.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-palmers-cocoa-butter-formula-skin-therapy-face-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Palmer's Skin Therapy Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Skin Therapy Face Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/F_gH1aIBm07LI5Bb8BwrOZDBKgU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Palmers-Cocoa-Butter-Formula-Moisturizing-Skin-Therapy-Face-Oil-453ba63d1a5e4bd0b86dec0ff1e0bf87.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Glow</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=1><p>Combines 10 different oils along with retinol and vitamin C for additional anti-aging benefits, all at a very affordable price point</p></li><li readability=0><p>Even though some of the oils are heavier, it’s still non-comedogenic</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may have seen the brand's name while shopping the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stretch mark cream</a> shelves at the drugstore. Palmer's may be best-known for their cocoa butter, but don’t sleep on this face oil. It combines a length list of 10 different oils, along with the namesake cocoa and shea butters. While that may sound like a recipe for an extra-greasy end result, we found that the opposite was true. It instead felt super light on our skin, absorbing quickly and leaving us with a nice finish that provided a solid base for our makeup. It doesn’t necessarily leave skin particularly glowy, but given that it’s also infused with retinol and vitamin C, you really can’t go wrong at this price point. While it can't replace a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>retinol serum</a>, it does provide some of the benefits of retinol in a gentler form. We’d even go so far to say that this was maybe better than some of the more expensive oils we’ve tried in the past — just be wary of the added fragrance in this one, as it may not be the friendliest towards sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>We’re happy to say that even after several months of use, we haven’t experienced any breakouts or irritation from this budget-friendly oil. In fact, we’ve only found ourselves wanting to integrate this oil further into our self-care routines. After hopping out of the shower, we also work small amounts onto our legs and rub a little bit onto our hands before going to bed — talk about being multi-functional.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Oils: </strong>Blend of 10, including sweet almond oil, grape seed oil, macadamia seed oil, sesame seed oil, coconut oil | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Hydration, anti-aging | <strong>Size:</strong> 1 oz.<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-2 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2518 data-sizes=750px alt="Bottle of Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Skin Therapy Face Oil laying on its side" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KK5egYUX8-0w05Zhq40cWAmuScI=/fit-in/1500x2518/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_Palmers_CocoaButterFormulaMoisturizingSkinTherapyOil-jthompson-0726-80c5f727cdb64096adf5c7a7ea59473b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person looking at the product box for Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Skin Therapy Face Oil" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/i27kw3yzWEjs3RyXUHlcubeKCPM=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/face-oils-test-palmers-cocoa-butter-formula-moisturizing-skin-therapy-jthompson-2224-e31b6e3b333c4c49844957b3b22e0e05.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-epara-balancing-face-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Epara Balancing Face Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Epara Balancing Face Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-fJ7m6AZbrQvw6RZW4qxD8gBwww=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/epara-balancing-face-oil-69f5f845dea14eab8bdf65a9c45226bb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstorm</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Glow</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Quality of the oil and packaging feels reflective of its high price point</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Luxe formula left our skin looking and feeling conditioned without being greasy</p></li><li readability=1><p>Thicker consistency felt more like a serum than a slippery oil, prepping our skin perfectly for makeup</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we’re spending $147 on a single ounce of facial oil, we want it to be worth every penny — and that’s just what the Epara Balancing Face Oil is. Its decadent concoction of moringa, marula, and ylang ylang oils come together to create an oil that not only evened our skin tone, brightened our complexions (even those hyper-pigmented spots) and left our skin feeling more supple than ever. It was incredibly rich for an oil, feeling denser than others between our fingertips and laying on like a base for our makeup (which it ended up being — and a great one, at that). This oil gave our faces a very natural luminescence that looked like our skin, only better, and served as a wonderful sealant on top of our bare skin. Our only qualm was that we didn’t see as glowy of a finish as we did with others, but this may be ideal for those with combination or oily skin. If you feel like splurging, this is the one we recommend — and as you only need a few small drops, a little goes a long way.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>Over the course of six months, we found ourselves in a rhythm with this luxe oil. Our skin liked it when we applied it three to four times a week (no more, or we’d be a little too oily), and this product ended up being our one saving grace when we came back from the beach with ultra-dry skin, needing to be nursed back to nourishment. With no declines in the product or its performance over half of a year, we still think it’s worth every penny.<strong></strong></p><p>Oils: Moringa, marula, ylang ylang III | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Brightens, moisturizes, softens, soothes | <strong>Size:</strong> 1.06 oz.<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2283 data-sizes=750px alt="Bottle of Epara Balancing Face Oil laying on its side" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/RvR74YdRiokHB8tMlpvrveVKnG0=/fit-in/1500x2283/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_Epara_BalancingFaceOil-jthompson-0762-2b55d930a11b45429bb63f1d555e2309.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person holding a box of Epara Balancing Face Oil" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/vTwZs-tyw4TmxZcNmBjFUSuNeRw=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/face-oils-test-epara-balancing-jthompson-1889-6d1c830d54a54d4f8cf735671da8bbb8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-skin-korres-wild-rose-brightening-absolute-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Dry Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Korres Wild Rose Brightening Absolute Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora KORRES Wild Rose Brightening Absolute Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YYAn2f0ybamJY1wmgpUa9p9VGJ8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/korres-wild-rose-brightening-absolute-oil-7ed34270ed0f4cffb4454da7d9c87713.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Glow</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=0><p>Has a lovely rose scent that adds to the experience of using it, as does the pretty&nbsp;packaging</p></li><li readability=0><p>Absorbs extremely quickly, though still imparts plenty of moisture</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To be fair, pretty much any and every face oil out there is a good option for those with dry skin, but this proved to be the best of the best. Those of us with dry skin loved how comfortable and light it felt, while still being extremely effective. This oil gets bonus points for its smoothing results and delightful rose scent, two qualities that made this oil feel like a spa facial in a bottle. Credit the fact that there’s rose oil and the petals of one full rose in every container — you can actually see the petals inside. Not only is rose a natural source of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skin-brightening vitamin C</a> in and of itself, there’s also extra vitamin C added to this formula, making it a great pick for those with an uneven skin tone. The category where this took a bit of a hit was value, as it definitely skews towards the pricier end of the spectrum.

Yep, you read that right — even with our normal to dry skin, we have seen noticeable changes in the smoothness and softness of our skin with consistent use of this mild oil, which has been gentle enough to be used daily without breakouts or blemishes.

The latter is a top recommendation from all of the dermatologists we spoke with. “It helps hydrate, is anti-inflammatory, and potentially even balances the skin’s oil production, making it a better option for oily skin,” says Dr Michele J. Farber, a dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in Philadelphia. For that reason, this is a top choice for all skin types, including even those prone to breakouts. Plus, it absorbs extremely quickly and is completely lightweight, so much so that we actually thought that it could’ve stood to be a bit richer. While it didn’t impart as much glow as many of the others on this list, it does contain the added benefit of vitamin C for antioxidant protection and skin-brightening, and has a reasonable price point given its multi-tasking abilities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>After several months of use, we’ve begun to love using this oil for skincare routines like weekly dermaplaning, as it provides a close shave and smooth surface for removing those dead skill cells and incredibly fine hairs. We’ve noticed that you need very little oil to get the best results with this formula, so this bottle will definitely last you quite a while.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Oils: </strong>Sesame seed oil, jojoba oil, oat kernel | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Hydration, brightening, soothing, antioxidant protection | <strong>Size:</strong> 1 oz.<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2592 data-sizes=750px alt="Kinship Kinskin Ceramide Barrier Repair Oil bottle laying on its side" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/9da5bgVlJkdOso1wqFM3yr-7Krc=/fit-in/1500x2592/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_Kinship_KinskinOatCeramideReliefFaceOil-jthompson-0673-871b88c9abc8421791daf42f0f90c24b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person rubbing Kinship Kinskin Ceramide Barrier Repair Oil onto their face" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ewNHjFaAJsowb8TjZY-kGvraUqM=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/face-oils-test-kinship-kinskin-oat-ceramide-relief-jthompson-2027-9f125925f95d4d0680c0d806a9c2a3f6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-le-prunier-plum-beauty-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Sensitive Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qB1fo8WBs_L0CvKubVkY8b1av7g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/le-prunier-plum-beauty-oil-14f1169f08c3489c9f66b36442e69097.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Le Prunier</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Glow</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=0><p>Delivers leaves skin with just the right amount of glow, without ever looking greasy</p></li><li readability=0><p>Contains only one ingredient, a boon for those with sensitive skin</p></li><li readability=1><p>Only need a very small amount to get the desired result, which means that the bottle lasts a long time</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those with sensitive skin, seeking out products that contain minimal ingredients is imperative. The fewer the ingredients, the fewer potential irritants. That’s part of the reason why we deemed this top for sensitive skin. It contains the namesake ingredient and the namesake ingredient only. Plum oil is packed with omega fatty acids for tons of moisture and nourishment, and is naturally-rich in all kinds of antioxidants (vitamin A, vitamin E, polyphenols and more) to protect skin from free radical damage. The level of glow it delivered was nothing short of magical, and even though it is one of our more expensive winners, we gave it a five out of five in the value category. This gentle oil is definitely worth the splurge, not only for its high-quality formula and ultra-safe results, but because you really will get your money’s worth. A little goes a long way — a drop a day will keep the dry skin away.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>By the end of this testing period, we’re likening the use of this oil to an act of self care — that’s how good it is. We notice visibly juicier skin even 12 hours after first applying it, which means that it works wonders for our skin from when we lay our heads down at night to several hours into our day. And not to mention that we feel extra good about its minimal ingredient list, which feels perfect for beginners.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Oils: </strong>Plum oil | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Hydration, antioxidant protection | <strong>Size:</strong> 1 oz.</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-10 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2539 data-sizes=750px alt="Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil bottle laying on its side" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/oio5NOxtWXnpqboDLELLL9xDF2w=/fit-in/1500x2539/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_LePrunier_PlumBeautyOil-jthompson-0706-ebc69a851650488987de41a2beda3585.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person holding a box of Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KXsIEHvMSgIWnevYt2Ls1gKTokc=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/face-oils-test-le-prunier-plum-beauty-jthompson-1964-4c96e537c2ea4f32b91dcae2018e24eb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-smoothing-frigg-attuning-face-potion></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Smoothing</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frigg Attuning Face Potion</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frigg Attuning Face Potion" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/B-TlXa0w0lpnP-3bu4LBW9WRJJw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frigg-attuning-face-potion-01a99126a166465fb769430704cbc1d1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Frigg</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Glow</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Inclusion of CBD helped smooth out our skin’s uneven texture</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Rich oil made a visible difference in the dryness of our skin</p></li><li readability=1><p>Can use this oil as a conduit for other skincare regimens, like sculpting with gua shas and other face tools</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it’s impossible to achieve perfectly smooth skin, the Frigg Attuning Face Potion is a dependable oil that can help you along the way. We noticed particularly smooth and hydrated skin after we started using this hemp-infused face oil, which includes both broad spectrum CBD and CBD to even out the planes of your skin, reduce the appearance of dark spots, control oil production (even though you’re adding droplets to your skin) and overall soothe your skin. We thought it hit all the right notes, absorbing quickly thanks to its lightweight consistency and leaving us with a luminescence that lasted until the morning. Its added ingredients of sea buckthorn oil and other botanical extracts make for a collagen-building cocktail that loved on our dry skin through both the cool and warm months, keeping our complexions balanced and moisturized despite the climate. While we did feel like there was a slightly greasy feel on our skin after we applied this oil, it was eventually absorbed and wasn’t something we felt should knock its overall performance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>At this rate, we’re recommending this oil to everyone — well, everyone with normal to dry skin, because they’ll really fall for the smoothing effects of this oil. We noticed a definite difference between when we started using this product and when we began using it less frequently (we cut back after the change of the seasons made our skin naturally more oily) and were shocked to see what a difference it made in the appearance (and texture) of our skin — basically, we felt best when we were using it. We’ve even started using it in other aspects of our skincare routine, like as a lubricant between our skin and our gua sha, to do a little lymphatic drainage.

When we first applied the product we immediately thought of what a relief this antioxidant-rich formula would be for dry or eczema-prone skin, as it applied on a bit syrupy but instantly smoothed out into a lightweight serum that sank effortlessly into our skin. Its hero ingredients of maqui, prickly pear, and acai were working in overdrive to make our skin look soft and supple while also restoring its vibrance, leaving us with an ethereal glow without making us look greasy or (actually) oily. We actually loved how our skin looked so much after rubbing in this oil that we felt confident enough to walk out onto the street wearing no other face makeup at all — it made our skin look more alive than any foundation could.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>Even after several months of testing we’re loving the life that this oil brings to our faces. We’ve started to get a little creative in the ways that we apply it outside of using it daily as part of our skincare routine, like dabbing a little over our foundation if it’s looking a bit cakey or restoring the glow to our skin if our powder is making us appear ashen. Since it’s not an overly greasy oil, we’re finding that there are endless ways to incorporate this nourishing concoction into our beauty regimes. Since we love it so much, we obviously want to douse ourselves in it, but unfortunately this has led to a few surprise spots on our face. Now we’d recommend around 2-3 drops of pure oil after cleanser for the best (non-pimply) results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Oils: </strong>Maqui, acai, goji, prickly pear, squalane | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Smoothing texture, moisturizing, anti-aging | <strong>Size:</strong> 1 oz.<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-14 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2421 data-sizes=750px alt="Youth to the People Superberry Hydrate + Glow Dream Oil bottle laying on its side" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/GfssaQLLmYMXL7YewjNSyYxGMes=/fit-in/1500x2421/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_YouthtothePeople_SuperberryHydrateandGlowOil-jthompson-0773-b32476a0e1dc4e3e94640189b8cc4127.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Youth to the People Superberry Hydrate + Glow Dream Oil" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/m0awOFcOCEwNeJ2Xe9yKvoSoyVQ=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/face-oils-test-youth-to-the-people-superberry-hydrate-glo-jthompson-1936-ec5da95641e040e78b8b467afb297ee3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-anti-aging-burts-bees-facial-oil-with-rosehip-seed-extract></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Anti-Aging</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Burt's Bees Facial Oil with Rosehip Seed Extract</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Burt's Bees Facial Oil with Rosehip Seed Extract" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/_kkICVEiunhCtEXP1q_NhT04xL4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/burts-bees-complete-nourishment-facial-oil-a6a72d1ecbf7430993f387a6818181e7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Glow</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>This drugstore favorite is extremely affordable and combines several different oils for a variety of benefits</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Formula is 99.9% natural and dermatologist-tested</p></li><li readability=0><p>Preserved our natural moisture during the cold of winter, keeping our skin soft and supple</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Consistency is on the heavier side and can sometimes leave a bit of a residue</p></li><li readability=0><p>Does contain fragrance, which can be an irritant for some</p></li><li readability=0><p>Does a better job at keeping skin moisturized than it does at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Serums and peels aren’t the only products that deserve a spot in your skincare routine—a good face oil can also be a great youth-boosting addition. Take this formula. Rosehip seed oil is one of the main ingredients: “It’s naturally-rich in antioxidants, which help to protect the skin against free radicals to prevent premature aging,” says Dr. Yadav. It can also help with hydration and elasticity, adds Dr. Farber. Per the hydration part, it proved to be one of the richer oils we tested; we felt that it didn’t absorb particularly well, as we could still feel it on our skin a few minutes after application. Still, for those with especially dry skin, to use in the winter, or as a final step in your skincare routine, this oil is a good choice. Not to mention that the price can’t be beat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>Over six months of testing, we noticed three things: The dosage amount was very consistent (when we used it twice a day, each bottle lasted us exactly three months), it got us through the winter, and we have noticed more moisturizing than anti-aging benefits. While it’s maybe too early to say that we haven’t noticed a difference in the aging of our skin, we do think that this oil provides far better moisture-locking properties than the reduction of fine lines or wrinkles. This product was extremely helpful during the cooler months of the year, keeping our skin soft and supple while the climate was harsh and dry. Especially for the price, we’d definitely keep buying this one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Oils: </strong>Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, evening primrose seed | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Hydration, anti-aging, antioxidant protection | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.05 oz.<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-16 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2837 data-sizes=750px alt="Burt's Bees Hydrating & Anti-Aging Facial Care bottle on its side" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/cJrDbsLtTrNu_ojFGq5oqS6n6NM=/fit-in/1500x2837/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_BurtsBees_HydratingandAntiAgingFacialCare-jthompson-0641-83070f405aa94ac1b83e2080e5cd5f75.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person rubbing Burt's Bees Facial Oil with Rosehip Seed Extract into her palm" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/oHma27_BHDdw7lnlQyuRzGlWyeA=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/face-oils-test-burts-bees-hydrating-anti-aging-facial-care-2204-80ffeb1409f445ad974306261a447951.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-vitamin-e-bio-oil-skincare-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Vitamin E</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bio-Oil Skincare Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bio-Oil Skincare Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XZX-33nt7E-Z3uxU2m8pCDnfeYI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bio-oil-skincare-oil-76aad52b0fa6402f96d87f59b27a3805.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>For being a powerhouse multitasker, this oil is fairly-priced</p></li><li readability=0><p>Functions not only as a skincare oil, but also as a treatment for stretch marks and scars</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We continuously wake up with a lit-from-within glow when we use this product</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This pick is affordable to begin with, but offers even a better value when you consider how many different ways it can be used. For starters, you can use it on your face, body, hair, cuticles — you name it. It both nourished our skin (without leaving any trace of greasy residue or sticky texture) and can even be used to help minimize the appearance of scars and/or stretch marks, which further contributed to it nabbing a perfect score in the value category. Along with the moisturizing oils that make up the base, vitamins E and A offer antioxidant protection, while other oils (calendula and rosemary) smoothed our skin. While we did like the fragrance (it wasn’t an overpowering scent), we want to note that it may be a potential irritant for those with sensitive skin types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>Over the months of testing we put its versatility to the test, using this oil not only on our faces, but our stretch marks, as well.

There were no greasy elements to this formula, and we didn’t feel any residue on our skin after we applied it. On top of that, it manages to strike the perfect balance of moisture, without being too heavy, making it beneficial for all skin types. Case in point: This worked equally well all over for those with combination skin types. We’re dinging it a bit for the high-end price point, but we liked how it made our skin feel so much that we’re willing to overlook that. Given the fact that many of the oils used in the formula — rosehip, pomegranate, sea buckthorn — are chock-full of antioxidants, this really could be used in place of an antioxidant serum, which helps justify the price a bit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up: </strong>Despite six months passing, we still continued to be surprised by the strength of this oil. It kept us adequately moisturized throughout the dry winter months, keeping our skin supple despite the cold conditions outside. We really noticed the sealing powers of this product when we applied it a bit after our moisturizer, letting the formula soak in to then be locked in place with the oil. Its thin consistency continues to make us think that this would be a great option for people with any skin type.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Oils: </strong>Rosehip, pomegranate, sea buckthorn, jojoba seed&nbsp;| <strong>Benefits:</strong> Hydration, brightening, antioxidant protection&nbsp;| <strong>Size:</strong> 1.01 oz.<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-20 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2283 data-sizes=750px alt="Kora Organics Noni Glow Face Oil bottle on its side" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XVRHs1tcQk3Ato5EuXaw0erPnY8=/fit-in/1500x2283/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_KORAOrganics_NoniGlowFaceOil-jthompson-0768-f2b8538179bb4031adbbdd04439558d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person holding a box of Kora Organics Noni Glow Face Oil" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JxrLD5BLgcfy93CU4xqxrJw2xnQ=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/face-oils-test-kora-organics-noni-glow-jthompson-2159-d9e715c05a5b46d8b0164640c2de9268.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-face-oils></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Face Oils</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Type of Oils</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We said it once, and we’ll say it again: Not all oils are created equal. Particularly if you’re concerned about breakouts or have oily skin to begin with, it’s important to choose wisely. For example, coconut oil tends to be comedogenic, clogging pores and potentially contributing to acne, notes Dr. King. On the flip side, argan and jojoba oils are non-comedogenic and can actually help balance the skin’s natural oil production, making them good for those with oily skin, she adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Other Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some face oils, like our best overall pick, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Acure Radically Rejuvenating Rose Argan Oil</a>, are made up of oils and oils alone.

There’s no right or wrong — just bear in mind that if you have sensitive skin, it’s always best to stick with products that have minimal ingredient lists.

After a minute or two, we looked in the mirror. Did our skin look shiny — greasy, even? Or did it look like it acquired an angelic glow? Did it feel absorbed enough where we could then continue on with makeup? All things we considered as we rated the oils from 1 to 5 (1 being the poorest performance, 5 being the highest) on the qualities of consistency, feel, absorption, glow (yes, this is an important rating to us), and overall value.&nbsp;The products that earned the highest average ratings were picked as our favorites for this list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once our favorites were selected, we sent those out to different testers for a new batch of people to implement them into their skincare routines for up to six months, checking in with their thoughts and feelings on each at the two and six month marks.
