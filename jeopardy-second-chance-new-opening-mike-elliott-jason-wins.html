We have made the decision to have one host for the syndicated show next season to maintain continuity for our viewers.</p><p>"And Ken Jennings will be the sole host for syndicated Jeopardy!. We are truly grateful for all of Mayim's contributions to Jeopardy!, and we hope to work with her in the future on primetime specials."</p><p>Mayim has since <a href=#>removed</a> "co-host @jeopardy" from her Instagram bio.</p><p>In 2021, (and after a slew of guest hosts with disgraced EP&nbsp;<a href=#>Mike Richards</a>&nbsp;named and un-named host), Mayim and&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;were tapped to host the&nbsp;<a href=#>game show</a>&nbsp;through the calendar year.</p><p>The following&nbsp;<a href=#>summer</a>&nbsp;Mayim and&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;were made the permanent hosts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>DECISION AXE-PLAINED</h2><p>Jeopardy!&nbsp;shared in their statement that "maintaining continuity" for viewers by having one host was why&nbsp;Mayim, 48, was ousted.</p><p>However, entertainment journalist Matthew Belloni, a founding partner at Puck News, has claimed otherwise.</p><p>He shared in his weekly newsletter on Monday the <a href=#>three issues that left parent company Sony: "done with Mayim Bialik."</a></p><p>The report claimed: "Bialik’s actions during the strike were at least a contributing factor, according to three sources close to the show."</p><p>Mayim hadn't been on-screen since last May,&nbsp;<a href=#>walking out of all things Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;when the WGA went on strike,&nbsp;<a href=#>later citing solidarity for her union.</a></p><p>The report continued: "Sony TV executive Suzanne Prete and [Jeopardy!] executive producer Michael Davies were furious when Bialik said in May that she would step away from the final week of filming last season in solidarity with the show’s striking writers.</p><p>"After all, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune are well-oiled machines, requiring precise timing to make the show’s five-episodes-a-day schedule."</p><p>The report also highlights two additional factors influencing the decision.</p><p>First, Bialik's reception on set was less than favorable, and second, Sony had adjusted shooting schedules last season to accommodate her since-canceled Fox sitcom&nbsp;<a href=#>Call Me Kat.</a></p><p>"Bialik wasn’t loved on set," Puck News claimed, but did not specify further. "And Sony had switched up shooting that [previous] season to accommodate her sitcom."</p><p>With Hollywood's strikes in the rearview, Jeopardy!'s parent company allegedly planned to let her go at the start of Season 41.</p><p>"Sony recently informed her that her services won’t be needed next season.</p><p>"She was offered the chance to stay on for the rest of this season, but she said no thanks," the report claimed.</p><p>According to Puck News, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Big Bang Theory</a>&nbsp;alum was pulling in an annual salary of $4 million.</p><p>Bialik’s compensation was allegedly set to increase by $1 million each year that she remained with the franchise.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Puck News also noted that Ken&nbsp;is also making $4 million a year, although that number is expected to increase now.</p><p>The late&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>&nbsp;reportedly made $10M a year as host.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/second-chance-tournament-debuts-huge-867372833.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/season-celebrities-constance-wu-fresh-828294322-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/taken-without-permission-https-www-866559677-4.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaWV%2BeHyUaKGep6CWv6XFjKycnKeemXqktMCnmp5lnprEbrvPnqWippdiuqq3xGacpaSZpMG1ecmaqqimXay2r7%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
