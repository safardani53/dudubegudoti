But there’s much more to it all than that.</p><p>So how is it possible Il Ridoto ends up second and Frero Banbou third? That boils down to comfort zones.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Virgin Bet: Bet £10 Get £20 in free bets - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only. £/€10 min stake (if EW then min £/€10 Win + £/€10 Place).

But what actually happened is the front two got most of their rivals out of sync, and they started making mistakes in trying to keep up.</p><p>Essentially, in the end most of the field was too tired to do what we would normally expect, and Fugitif probably should have won more easily than he did.</p><p>I’d suggest it showed just how difficult Fugitif is to win on, and I wouldn’t be thinking about him in a similar race next time even though he was my Nap of the weekend in the paper Saturday.</p><p>Gavin Sheehan worked wonders on the winner. He’s in great form this term and showing everyone what he can do. He might be the pin-up boy of the jumps weighing room, but Sheehan has the ability to match his charm.</p><p>Sam Twiston-Davies also has charm, and you rarely he find him without a smile on his face when you meet him at the racecourse.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>But I know that Twiston-Davies is incredibly competitive. He wants to be battling with Sean Bowen and Harry Cobden for the jockeys’ championship and gets frustrated when his talents are not noted.</p><p>This column has noted them for a long time, and he was brilliant on Broadway Boy in the fabulous and unique Favourite From The Sun Now Daily Handicap Chase.</p><p>I loved seeing a novice put it up to the established chasers like Protektorat, and Broadway Boy’s head carriage was a joy as he stretched for the line.</p><p>It was a terrific ride from Twiston-Davies for his old man Nigel, and brother Willie Twiston-Davies is also very much part of this story as he does much of the work at home.</p><p>That said, surely any horse in the Twisty yard will think twice of winning if seeing Sam and Willie the next morning in a dressing gown and onesie is their surprise the next morning. Even by my dressing standards Sam has smashed the pink pyjama look here!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DE9E13AE-99FF-461E-9A61-4ECEE5DFA041.jpeg><p>Speaking of jockeys, Harry Cobden was just piling on the pressure to Sean Bowen before the latter banged in a treble at Southwell on Sunday.</p><p>Olly Murphy is proving the key handler for Bowen, and while the pair had disappointment with Thunder Rock at Cheltenham they also enjoyed a decent victory via Go Dante.</p><p>Cobden’s issue in closing in is that he relies on his boss Paul Nicholls banging winners in at the major fixtures, while Bowen can run riot on the quieter days.</p><p>It means we are all set for a good battle between the pair. For me Bowen has built up a big enough lead to hold on - he’s 30-odd in front at the time of writing - but it could still get interesting. Both are fine ambassadors.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>This is, of course, the final Monday Yeeehaaa before Christmas.
