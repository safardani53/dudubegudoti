If the fog is so severe that you’re struggling to see other vehicles, switch on your fog lights.</p><p>''But don’t keep switching them off and on again, as this can confuse other drivers."</p><h2>Is it ever against the law to use your fog lights?</h2><p>If you use your fog lights when it isn't foggy you could be endangering other road users and potentially breaking the law.</p><p>You should never use your fog lights in rain or drizzle - and could be <a href=#>fined</a> by the <a href=#>police</a> if caught.</p><p>The Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 says that it is illegal <a href=#>to use your lights to dazzle drivers coming towards you</a>.</p><p>Fog lights are very bright, which means they shouldn't be used in normal weather.</p><p>Switching or <a href=#>leaving your fog lights</a> on when it's clear, or if it's just rainy, or in light mist where visibility is greater than 100m, could land you with a fine.</p><h2>What is the penalty for using fog lights incorrectly?</h2><p>If you use your fog lights incorrectly, you could be fined <a href=#>£30 at the roadside.</a></p><p>You won't get <a href=#>penalty points</a> if dealt with in this way.</p><p>If you cause an accident or injure somebody, the penalties could be much harsher and include points, bigger fines and even a ban.</p><h2>How do you turn on your fog lights?</h2><p>Every car is different, so you'll need to check your manual to be sure you know how to switch on your fog lights.</p><p>But in general, you would start by switching on your headlights as normal.</p><p>Then locate the fog light symbol - which may be on the&nbsp;indicator stalk with the other light functions.</p><p>You may have to rotate the end of the stalk, or flick a switch to the right or left of the steering wheel.</p><p>Alternatively, it could be a button to press on your dashboard.</p><p>Whatever the method, you should familiarise yourself with how to turn the lights on before you go out in more <a href=#>weather</a>.</p><p>You also need to make sure you remember to turn them off again when they are no longer necessary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHx1hJFtam1wX5u8qHnLop6hrKNisKK%2BjKywppqfocBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
