They use sprays or fogs that kill eggs and fleas.</p><p>But if you're looking to sort it yourself, here's what you'll need to do to get your home flea-free:</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON CLEANING">READ MORE ON CLEANING</h2><h3>1. Clear the floor</h3><p>Move all furniture that a tiny flea can get underneath and pick up everything on the floor that doesn't need to be there.</p><h3>2. Evacuate the house</h3><p>To get rid of fleas in your house you need to get everyone else out for a bit too; so your family and pets all need to go out for a while.</p><h3>3. Remove anything belonging to your pet</h3><p>That includes <a href=#>dog beds</a>, food dishes, toys etc. Even cover the fish tank.</p><h3>4. Look for flea dirt</h3><p>Mostly this looks like black pepper. But it isn't, it's poo, and flea blood. There will be pupae, larvae and eggs in there too.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Flea larvae eat flea dirt while they grow, then they feed on blood from you and your pets.</p><p>Fleas are the bits that move, but they're very ellusive.</p><p>They like to hide in carpets, out of direct sunlight, so stay alert!</p><h3>5. Vacuum everything</h3><p><a href=#>Vacuum</a> everything throughout your whole house, all the floors and furniture, even the pillows and cushions.</p><p>Get under any remaining furniture you can and get right into the edges and corners of the rooms.</p><p>Vacuuming prepares your house for using insecticides as well as getting rid of some of the fleas, their dirt, eggs, larvae and offspring.</p><p>When you are done, empty your vacuum cleaner into a bag outside your home, tie the bag and put it in an outside bin.</p><h3>6. Repeat every day</h3><p><a href=#>Vacuum thoroughly like this every day</a>; you need to keep removing fleas or any remaining juveniles are going to keep hatching in your home.</p><p>Some recommend brushing salt and/or baking soda through your carpets as these dehydrate the fleas.</p><h3>7. Steam clean</h3><p>Heat from a <a href=#>steam cleaner</a> will kill fleas for good.</p><p>If you can't steam clean, wash everything you can with hot soapy water, this also kills adult fleas.</p><h3>8. Use a household flea spray</h3><p>Follow the instructions on the packaging carefully.</p><p>You will need to do this more than once to get fleas out of your house, so make sure you've got plenty of it.</p><h3>9. Consider changing your pet's bed</h3><p>If you only had a small number of fleas in your house and they haven't been there long, wash pet bedding, bowls, etc.</p><p>If you had a lot of fleas in your home, or they have been resident with you for a while, destroy pet bedding and buy your pets lovely new beds.</p><p>As a general rule, you should wash your pets' bedding at least once a month.</p><h2>To get rid of fleas on my pets</h2><p>Fleas can live on your pets, causing them skin irritation and putting them at risk of serious disease.</p><p>Thankfully there are a number of things you can try to alleviate your poor pooch's discomfort.</p><h3>1. Brush your pet</h3><p>To be sure it is fleas, <a href=#>brush </a>your pet carefully over a light-coloured surface with a fine comb.</p><p>Sprinkle a little water on anything that comes off, and if it turns a reddish brown, then that's flea dirt and it is likely your pet has fleas.</p><p>Flea dirt is essentially flea poo and blood, and there will be eggs, larvae and pupae in there too. Yuck!</p><h3>2. Consult your vet</h3><p>Contact a vet, you might need a powder or spray to treat the adult fleas, and another treatment to deal with their hatchlings later on.</p><h3>3. Give your pet a bath</h3><p>This may soothe your pet from any itching, and you could use a flea-treatment shampoo which will help deal with the adult fleas.</p><p>Some recommend spraying your pet with rosemary water as rosemary is thought to repel fleas.</p><h3>4. Thoroughly brush again</h3><p>After the bath, comb your pet with a fine-tooth flea comb.</p><p>A flea comb catches the fleas and debris out of your pet's coat while allowing their hair to pass through.</p><p>It will remove fleas, alive or dead, and any flea poop from your pet's fur and body.</p><p>Fleas tend to feed near the neck, ears and tail, so pay particular attention to those areas.</p><p>The gentle scratching of the comb might sooth any irritation from the fleas, but take care, your pet's skin may have been irritated by them.</p><h3>5. Kill any fleas you find</h3><p>Kill any fleas you find on your comb by dipping it in hot soapy water.</p><p>This is the best way to kill the fleas because they jump quickly, and so are hard to squash.</p><h3>6. Comb once a week</h3><p>Repeat the combing once a week until the fleas have gone. Regular combing will also prevent them coming back.</p><p>Your pet will also enjoy the attention from you, and combing and brushing acts like a massage for them.</p><h3>7. Use a preventative treatment</h3><p>Contact your vet to find a preventative treatment to stop your pet getting fleas again.</p><p>This may be a spot treatment, a tablet, or both, but will be easy for you to administer at home.</p><h3>8. Buy a flea collar</h3><p>Flea collars&nbsp;release a chemical on to the skin or fur of your pet that helps in warding off fleas.</p><p>These chemicals will kill any insect present on the body of your pet.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h3>9. Eradicate fleas from your home</h3><p>If your pet has fleas it is likely your home does too, so your pet could pick them up again.</p><p>Of the 2,000 types of flea, only one lives on humans, so you might be bitten, but probably not lived upon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoB4hZdpaGpnmKTEbrPErWSroZRis62xwKxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
