Unfortunately tonight we have received some very poor and unacceptable behaviour within our restaurant.</p><p>"A table of three who we accommodated for tonight have ended up leaving our restaurant refusing to pay a £81.90 bill and being very rude and confrontational towards our staff.</p><p>"After being questioned on this behaviour towards a young waitress the very worrying response was given that 'if she’s not man enough to take it she shouldn’t be working in hospitality'.</p><p>"Behaviour like this will not be tolerated within our restaurant.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"The table of three have also informed us that they will be writing an awful review, unfortunately due to us being a small business negative reviews can really effect the image of our restaurant, we are so upset with the behaviour that has taken place tonight and we please just ask everyone to be kind. Thank you from the exo team."</p><p>Exo Poli describes itself on its social media site as “a little bit of <a href=#>Crete</a> in Shrewsbury”.</p><p>Reviewers on <a href=#>TripAdvisor</a> would seem to like the restaurant where it has a rating of 4.5/5.</p><p>Earlier this month, a <a href=#>pub owner responded to an “unfair” review</a> and gave his own response to the unhappy diner.</p><p>Plough Inn owner Mark hit back at a visitor who claimed the restaurant near Bewdley, in <a href=#>Worcestershire</a>, served "tasteless food" with "uncomfortable cutlery".</p><p>The anonymous customer posted on Tripadvisor: "The ice cream was very icy, the lemon meringue filling like glue and the cream like water.</p><p>"We now understand why they take payment before feeding you...stay well clear!"</p><p>Having seen the review, Mark decided to share his own thoughts.</p><p>He wrote: "Right then how do I address this unadulterated b*****t? Let’s say it as it is shall we.</p><p>"If we could rate you on Tripadvisor you would probably get three stars, maybe if you could have thought just that little bit harder (PROBLEM I SUPPOSE) and said you tripped up on the way in, then bumped your head on the beam to the restaurant, you would achieve the five star status!</p><p>"Now then I’ll notify Heineken that their Fosters lager has to much water in it and no bubbles. I’ll put a strong recommendation into our chefs, to change their recipes (even though they execute 10 thousand meals a month).</p><p>"I will ask McVities if they could give us there recipe for Yorkshire puddings. I’ll certainly advise Sheffield Steel that the cutlery is a bad design even though they’ve pioneered this design over the last 200 years (they will probably recommend you eat with a spade and a rake out of a bucket).</p><p>"Bennett’s ice cream will be a little bewildered as it’s an award winning ice cream. And finally I will inform BRAKEBROS not to use glue in their lemon meringue.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"Now then getting back to you - first review I notice.
