In mid-life men most hair loss is hormonal and not linked to these conditions.</p><p>Spencer said:“Harry has experienced a significant amount of hair loss as a result of male pattern baldness."</p><p>Harry cruelly called his brother William’s hair loss “alarming” in his controversial autobiography Spare - but Wills seemingly embraced his baldness by forking out £180 for a No1 buzz cut back in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, it appears that Harry is doing all he can to hold onto his ginger thatch.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources said he also underwent a thickening procedure at the prestigious Philip Kingsley Trichological Clinic in London’s Mayfair in 2020, where treatments can cost up to £236 a month.</p><p>This top package involves clients applying daily topical scalp drop solution of Minoxidi and consuming a daily oral capsule which works by “blocking the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone.”</p><p>A source at the time said: “Harry’s visit caused a real stir. This company is so prestigious. It’s one of the best places in the world. It’s got a whole range of different treatment plans.</p><p>“The richest, most famous and well-connected use it. The meeting with Harry went well."</p><p>Harry is far from alone in seeking out treatments, with the UK hair loss market being worth £6million in 2020, with top products including vitamin supplements and hair loss treatments.</p><p>It isn’t the first time people queried if a photo had been retouched, after his Time 100 cover with <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> in September 2021 where he sported a thick head of hair.</p><p>Harry’s visit caused a real stir.
