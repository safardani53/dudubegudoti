This guy is just built differently,” added another.&nbsp;</p><p>While a third added: “I love Eminem but this guy really has a bar in his new song mocking the Ariana Grande concert bombing and then has a explosion noise straight after.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000578481849.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000615636789.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000610332290.jpg><p>Earlier in 2020, he defended lyrics in Unaccommodating in which he rapped “I’m contemplating yelling ‘bombs away’” in reference to the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena in 2017.</p><p>He insisted “certain sections” of his songs were “designed to shock the conscience” and were “not made for the squeamish.”</p><p>In the new album, an extended version of the one released in January and surprised the music world today, <a href=#>he also takes aim at Billie Eilish who previously said she is “terrified” of the rapper</a>.</p><p>In Alfred’s Theme, he says: “But really I’m just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes, which is really childish and silly, but I’m really like this, I’m giving nightmares to Billie Eilish.”</p><p>He also reignited his favorite feud with ex-girlfriend Mariah Carey by comparing her to an outcast, in These Demons, when he says: “I got a question, what rhymes with Pariah?”</p><p>In the same album, he apologized to Rihanna after he claimed in a 2019 leaked song that he "sided with Chris Brown."</p><p>Eminem&nbsp;"wholeheartedly" <a href=#>apologized to Rihanna</a> and said it was "wrong" of him to support Chris, in the song, Zeus, on&nbsp;<a href=#>his new surprise album</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>He raps: "But, me, long as I re-promise to be honest / And wholeheartedly, apologies, Rihanna.</p><p>"For that song that leaked, I'm sorry, Ri / It wasn't meant to cause you grief.
