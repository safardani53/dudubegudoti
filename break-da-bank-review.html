The game will remind you of retro titles not only because of the 3x5 grid but because of the BAR and $ symbols.&nbsp;</p><p>While there is a Wild symbol and multipliers, there are no free spins or any other type of bonus features. The reels are set upon an attractive purple background with a stack of coins below. Here is some key information about Break da Bank:</p><ul><li><strong>Developer</strong>: Microgaming (Games Global)</li><li><strong>Slot type</strong>: Classic&nbsp;</li><li><a href=#><strong>RTP</strong></a>: 95.75%&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Theme</strong>: Money and riches&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Reels</strong>: Three</li><li><strong>Paylines</strong>: Five</li><li><strong>Volatility</strong>: High&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the wager limits for Break da Bank slot game?</h2><p>You can wager from £5 to £250 per spin, so you can see the game may be more suited to high rollers with a high minimum bet. For a win you have to hit three matching symbols on a payline, and if there are Wilds as part of the winning line they will multiply the win.</p><p>You can adjust your bet via the ‘chip’ icon, and use the ‘Coin Size’ slider. This has a minimum of 1.00 and a max of 50.00. Each value is multiplied by five, which is the number of fixed paylines.</p><p>Being an older game there are not as many features in it and the setting options are limited. The only sounds are when you spin the reels, which mimic real slot machines. There’s a ‘Quickspin’ option to speed up the reels, too.</p><ul><li><strong>Minimum stake</strong>: £5&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Maximum stake</strong>: £250&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Maximum win</strong>: 480x your stake</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Casino-Bonuses-MrQ-OP.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the theme of Break da Bank slot game?&nbsp;</h2><p>The theme of Break da Bank is money and riches.
