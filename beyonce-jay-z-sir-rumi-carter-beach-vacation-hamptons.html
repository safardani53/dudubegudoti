The happy family headed to Jay’s home state of New York, where they hit the sand and the surf in the Hamptons to chill, following Beyonce’s massive, whirlwind press tour for The Lion King. We seldom see Jay and Bey’s youngest kids out and about, and while the doting parents made sure that their little ones were kept mostly covered by sunshades and umbrellas, it was clear that they were having tons of fun. Those tiny matching ruffled playsuits were to die for, too!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The last good glimpse we had of Rumi and Sir was earlier in 2019, when Beyonce included the twins in a montage video about the joys of last year. There the babies were, clear as day, in a snippet of their famous parents’ secret <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>vow renewal</a> ceremony. Blink and you’ll miss it, but Rumi could be seen giggling, while Sir smiled at the camera as Bey and Jay said “I do” again in the background. “At 36, I became a new mother of three,” Beyonce says in a voiceover. “I breastfed my twins. I renewed my vows with my husband of 10 years.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Rumi an Sir’s big sister, seven-year-old<strong> Blue Ivy Carter</strong>, wasn’t along for the family getaway. They may just have not fit into her busy schedule! After all, Blue just became the youngest person to get on the Billboard Top 100 after appearing on, and writing lyrics to her mom’s new hit, “Brown Skin Girl”. She has a side gig, too. Grandma Tina Knowles said at BeautyconLA on August 10 that Blue is a gifted makeup artist who can put even the most influential of influencers to shame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jay-z-beyonce-twins-beach-picnic-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“We have fun. And she’s quite a makeup artist. She’s amazing,” Tina said. “Eyes. Oh my god, she puts stones and all this fancy stuff. She can do a perfect cat eye.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH15e5BrZpudqaS7pLGMo5iyZapiwKq%2BjKuspqFdmK6zwMSrZJudkZi1bsLAnJitoZ%2BjeqmtzKmrqKajZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
