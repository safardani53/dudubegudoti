That didn’t stop them from trolling LeBron on Twitter, though.</p><p>After playing their final game of the NBA season on Sunday night, they tweeted, “I’m officially out for the season.” “I’ll see you all in the fall.”</p><p>It was a carbon copy, down to the emojis, of LeBron’s somewhat ill-timed April Fool’s joke about being out for the rest of the season. James admitted it was a joke, but it backfired because he missed the final five games of the season, and the Lakers missed the playoffs.</p><p>Fans, understandably, have mocked LeBron since he tweeted it.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I’m out for the season officially. 🤦🏾‍♂️. See y’all in the fall. 👑✌🏾</p><p>— Orlando Magic (@OrlandoMagic) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">April 11, 2022</a></p><h2>The Lakers Fired Frank Vogel</h2><p>The Lakers fired head coach Frank Vogel after three seasons on Monday (April 11). The former Pacers coach won a championship with the Lakers in 2020, but he paid the price for the team’s poor play this season.</p><p>The Lakers’ general manager, Rob Pelinka, stated, “This is an incredibly difficult decision to make, but one we feel is necessary at this point.”</p><p>“I have tremendous respect for Frank both on and off the court,” Pelinka, the Lakers’ vice-president of basketball operations, added.</p><p>“Frank is a fantastic coach and a wonderful human being.” We will be eternally grateful to him for his efforts in leading us to the NBA championship in 2019-20.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>LeBron James</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Orlando Magic</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGimq6SRo7GwecyanqKbXam%2FsLjLZqOemqKku262wKacrGWnnsGpedKarZqflWLBuLHErWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
