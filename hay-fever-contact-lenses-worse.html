Blurry vision.</p><p>When allergens come into contact with your lenses, natural substances are produced excessively in your tears, says <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vision Direct</a>.</p><p>As a result, your contact lenses can become very blurry. By referring to the daily <a href=#>pollen count,</a> you'll know if allergens are present. You can also ask an optician about eye drops which will alleviate the symptoms so that your contact lenses are cleaner for longer.</p><p>And of course, there's the chance that you may inadvertently trap little fragments of pollen between your eye and the contact - meaning that you can't escape the irritant.</p><h2>So, what can you do to reduce your irritation?</h2><p><strong>Switch to dailies</strong></p><p>Reusing contacts significantly increases your risk of allergies and other foreign objects from building up on the contact surface.</p><p>By putting a new set on every day, you're reducing that risk.</p><p><strong>Wear your glasses</strong></p><p>But to really nip your hay fever woes in the bud, you're better of just wearing your specs.</p><p>Wearing glasses instead of contacts during particularly sensitive periods can make a big difference.</p><p><strong>Use eye drops</strong></p><p>There are some NSAID (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) eye drops that are specially formulated to provide temporary relief from hay fever symptoms.</p><p>Check to see if you need to apply them for a certain period before you put in your contacts as your eyes might need time to settle.</p><p>Go to your GP to ask for a prescription.</p><p><strong>Give yourself a break</strong></p><p>You shouldn't be wearing contacts for over 12 hours at a time and you definitely shouldn't sleep in them.</p><p>If you do suffer from hay fever, remember to give yourself from your contacts - even if it's just taking them out when you get home.</p><p><strong>Consider immunotherapy</strong></p><p>If you really struggle every year then you might want to consider immunotherapy.</p><p>By injecting the allergen into your arm, you will eventually develop immunity and no medication will be required to treat it.</p><p>And whatever you do, never take a shower in contacts or you could end up like Nick Humphreys.</p><p>We reported how <a href=#>he'd gone blind in one eye</a> after a water-borne parasite bore into his eye from showering while wearing lenses.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE ON HAY FEVER</h2></p><p>According to a poll by YouGov for the charity Fight for Sight, 56 per cent of contact lens wearers wear their contacts for longer than the recommended 12 hours a day.</p><p>54 per cent saying they'd swum or showered in them.</p><p>47 per cent said they had slept with contacts in, and 15 per cent said they'd put their contacts in their mouth to "clean" or lubricate them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfboF3hY9wamigka56p7HVnqlmm5%2BjwaKv02ajnqajmsBuw86rqp5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
