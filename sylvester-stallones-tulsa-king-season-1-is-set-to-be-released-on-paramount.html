There will be ten episodes in all.&nbsp;Tulsa King is the kind of narrative that established Taylor Sheridan’s reputation. Following the success of Yellowstone, in 1883, and the Mayor of Kingstown, this might be another hit in a long series of superb television programs. Dana Delany, Garrett Hedlund, and Andrea Savage all appear in the series.</p><p>Tulsa King will debut on Paramount on November 20, 2022, at 9 p.m. EST, after the new season of Yellowstone. Before then, the program will make its formal premiere on Paramount+ on November 13, 2022. Because there is no mention of air time, it is reasonable to presume that the new program will follow in the footsteps of others on the streaming site and premiere at 3 a.m. EST.</p><p></p><h2>Tulsa King season 1 trailer: A painful return to a life of crime</h2><p>For the next Taylor Sheridan performance, two teasers and one full trailer were published. The whole trailer was released roughly a month ago. The video highlights the challenges of a freshly freed former New York mafia captain after completing a 25-year jail sentence.&nbsp;This is one of the most important aspects of the story. When he returns, he does not seem to be accepted back into the “family.” Instead, he is sent to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to create a new headquarters for the family. As the stylish trailer suggests, this is no simple task, particularly for a guy just out of jail.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sylvester-Stallones-Tulsa-King-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The whole setup in the video is supported by some terrific peppy music that highlights the urgency and perils hiding in the depths of Oklahoma’s capitol. According to the show’s official synopsis:</p><p>“Tulsa King’ follows New York mafia capo Dwight “The General” Manfredi (Sylvester Stallone) shortly after he is freed from jail after 25 years and summarily banished by his master to set up business in Tulsa, Okla. Realizing that his mafia family may not have his best interests at heart, Dwight steadily assembles a “crew” of unusual personalities to assist him in establishing a new criminal empire in a location that may as well be another planet to him.”</p><p>Stallone plays the protagonist, Manfredi, while Dana Delany plays his love interest. Delany portrays Margaret, a rancher, and trustee of the Annie Oakley Society. Stallone also serves as an executive producer on the show, with Taylor Sheridan, Terrence Winter, David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, David Hutkin, Allen Coulter, and Brad Aftergood.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sylvester-Stallones-Tulsa-King-2.jpg alt="Sylvester Stallone's Tulsa King" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Martin Starr, Jay Will, Max Casella, Domenick Lombardozzi, and Garrett Hedlund all appear in the show.
