Check out these exclusive insider facts from Criminal Minds Writer Breen Frazier.</strong></p><p><img align alt fid=469630 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/57/31/5c34d180ee8764a7_diana_in_trunk.gif vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Familiar faces</strong>. <a href=#>Dr. Reid's season-long story arc</a> allowed for Criminal Minds writers to "tell a serialized story" that climaxed with returning guest stars, including <a href=#>Aubrey Plaza</a>, Gia Mantegna, and, of course, <a href=#>Shemar Moore.</a></p><p><strong>Commitment to clash. </strong>Because the battle between Reid and Cat was "such a charged rivalry" in <a href=#>last season's "Entropy,"</a> bringing them back to the table for round two was especially exciting. "Aubrey Plaza and <a href=#>Matthew Gray Gubler</a>&nbsp;are friends and enjoy working together. Both bring such a high level of commitment to the scenes," added Frazier.</p><p><strong>All that glitters.</strong> Cat's luxurious fantasy room was filmed at Anoush Banquet Hall in North Hollywood.</p><p><img align alt fid=469629 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/57/30/845cac58dfeadf97_fancy_room.jpg vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Cat and mouse</strong>. Did you notice how Cat casually brought up <a href=#>Maeve and Gideon, the two most painful losses in Reid's life</a>, during their conversation? Frazier shared, "Cat bringing up Maeve further proves that she must have had an inside source feeding her information. This allowed her to frame him and play mind games with him."</p><p><strong>All in the family.</strong> Joe Mantegna, who stars as <a href=#>SSA David Rossi</a>, was joined on set by his daughter, Gia, who guest starred as Lindsey Vaughn. "Both <a href=#>Joe</a> and Gia Mantegna were thrilled to be on set together again," added Frazier. Gia's first appearance as Vaughn was in&nbsp;<a href=#>Season 3's "Third Life."</a></p><p><img align alt fid=469097 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/57/19/7ce21dc32f537869_gia_collage.jpg vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Love games</strong>. As punishment for putting her lover, Cat Adams, in jail, Lindsey Vaughn framed Reid and kidnapped his mother. However, Vaughn's heartbreak over her lover's pregnancy proved to be their undoing. "[Vaughn] felt betrayed by the act, which was clearly done to play mind games with Reid," said Frazier.</p><p><strong>What the truck?</strong> Eagle-eyed Criminal Minds fans may have noticed that the final scene, when the team rode over spike strips, flipping their vehicles, and landing upside down in a truck's bright headlights, seemed familiar. This was a purposeful nod from the Season 12 premiere episode. "Director Glenn Kershaw saw the semi truck crash as a fitting end to the season given that the first scene of the premiere had a near miss with a tractor trailer," explained Frazier.</p><p><img align alt fid=469099 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/57/19/08f41f6dda508f8a_car_gets_hit.gif vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>We want Moore.</strong> Baby Girls everywhere rejoiced upon the return of <a href=#>Derek Morgan</a> in the season finale of Criminal Minds. Freezier shared, "We love <a href=#>Shemar</a> and the door is always open for him to come back... While we miss him dearly, his CM family is rooting for his success and we hope the show will be on the air this fall!"</p><p><img align alt fid=469104 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/57/20/c4c50523f70674ce_110034_1289b_copy.jpg vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Watch the season finale of&nbsp;Criminal Minds, <a href=#>"Red Light,"</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>CBS All Access.</a></p><p>Watch&nbsp;<a href=#>Criminal Minds</a>&nbsp;on CBS and <a href=#>CBS All Access.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa3RmqSorZ6pva3B0meaqKVfqLWww9JomquhnZ67ori%2BpqCnnKNku6bD0mhoaWhnZn1ze8eeqZ5lo2K1sMOMmmSgmZ2aerCyjJyYrWWRo7Fuuc6uqp5lpJ6ypXnUqWStoJmoerSxwKymp2Wfm3qkvsimoKeZnGK6qrrDrGRrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
