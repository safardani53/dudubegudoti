I know that you got me there, but I really feel stable in myself to the point where, like, I could let you go,” Craig told his partner. “I would be really sad, but I wouldn’t freak out, if that makes sense.”</p><p>Despite feeling confident in himself, Craig was quick to take Paige’s temperature about their relationship, asking, “But, like, do you hope it works out with me?”</p><p>Paige let out a laugh, replying, “Yes! I wouldn’t be here. I would be in New York.” Craig joked, “So you’re saying you like me?” to which she responded, “Yeah, I definitely like you.”</p><p>The twosome, who have been <a href=#>dating since summer 2021</a>, shared a hug and Craig added, “I love you.” Paige smiled, replying, “I love you too, Craig!” and joked, “Look at me, I’m in all pastels, obviously I love you.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the episode, Craig confessed that he does “wish” that he and Paige were “on the same timeline” when it comes to their future. Craig has previously said <a href=#>he’s ready to be a dad</a> and settle down, while Paige has been adamant that getting engaged would mean <a href=#>she’d have to leave her home</a> in New York, which she’s not ready to do just yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Craig-Conover-Tells-Paige-DeSorbo-Not-the-End-of-the-World-If-They-Break-Up-on-Southern-Charm-2.jpg><p>“I’m so appreciative that I have someone that I get along with and that I love,” Craig said in a confessional interview while reflecting on his relationship. “All that matters is that I’m happy and she’s supportive of me. Technically, until we have children, it doesn’t matter where we live.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Paige revealed that while the couple aren’t engaged, they <a href=#>almost tied the knot in Las Vegas</a> during BravoCon in November.</p><p>“I said, ‘Let’s go do it in a chapel,’” she recalled to Elite Daily in an interview published on Monday, December 18. “Craig chickened out, though.”</p><p>Craig confessed, “I’m not going to get married in Vegas. I want something more real than that.” Paige then teased, “What’s more real than me, you, and Elvis, honey?”</p><p>Paige <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> that she wasn’t in “a rush to do anything” with Craig in October 2022. She revealed that the pair achieved a “really big milestone” at the time when she gave Craig “closet space” at her NYC apartment.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Paige explained that giving Craig “some room and a closet” was her “version of being engaged.” She recalled, “He was very, very happy. I mean, I thought he was gonna cry at [one] moment. He was like, ‘I can’t believe you did this for me.’ And I was like, ‘Stop. Don’t make it a thing!’”</p><p>Southern Charm airs on Bravo Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqoraSdsrO6jJyfmqqdqHqkvsCinmabn6O8t7HRZqeaoZeaerS8y6KrZq%2BfqrmlutNmmZ5llaOxbrvFZq6oqpyZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
