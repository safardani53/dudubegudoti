And who would believe this s–t? And you believed it!”</p><p>In 2011, the Post ran a story called “Jeter’s Booty Hauls” alleging that the athlete — then at the height of his baseball career — gave women “gift baskets of autographed memorabilia” after spending the night with them. One woman claimed that she received gift baskets on two separate occasions, though Post columnist <strong>Emily Smith</strong> later said the outlet didn’t confirm whether the woman had actually hooked up with Jeter or just visited him.</p><p>The former shortstop didn’t address the article at the time, but he now says there’s not any truth to it. “It’s a story that became larger than life,” he explained in the ESPN series, which premieres on Monday, July 18. “People keep regurgitating this story that never happened. Never happened.”</p><p>The rumor took on a life of its own, however, to the point that strangers would confront Jeter about how they adopted the gift basket strategy in their own lives.</p><p>“I remember being at a Starbucks one time and there’s some random guy behind me and he says, ‘Hey, I just want to let you know that I’m giving out gift baskets because you did,'” the New Jersey native recalled. “And I turned around and said, ‘You’re a f–kin’ idiot!’ And the look on his face. … Like, did he think I was gonna say, ‘Yeah, good job, man!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Derek-Jeter-Finally-Addresses-Rumor-He-Gave-Gift-Baskets-to-1-Night-Stands-2.jpg><p>The Baseball Hall of Famer is now happily married to <a href=#><strong>Hannah Jeter</strong></a> (née Davis), but he was linked to a long list of famous women before he and the model, 32, began their romance in 2012.
