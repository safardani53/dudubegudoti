"I am mortified to have to tell my parents this and my family this. I do not care what TMZ thinks about it. That was all I was thinking about: 'These are the people I love that I have to tell, and also, I'm pregnant. There's a human being growing inside of me, and I'm so young, I'm almost a baby myself.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After announcing her pregnancy news, Spears decided to "hide away for a little bit" and moved to Mississippi to avoid the spotlight.

It's not like I was in L.A. walking down the middle of the most popular boulevard; I was in the-middle-of-nowhere Mississippi," she recalled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spears stayed in the state for the duration of her pregnancy and privately welcomed Maddie with only her family members present, including her sister <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Britney</a> and brother <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Bryan</a>, who flew in to meet their new niece.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maddie spent her early days in Mississippi with her two parents until their split in 2010, when she was 19 months old. Spears and Maddie then relocated to the Spears' home state of Louisana, where she met businessman James Watson. Spears and Watson later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>married</a> in 2014 in New Orleans.

Magazine, published in July 2008. On the cover, a tiny Maddie is dressed in white as she cuddles against her smiling mom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was right on schedule," Spears told the outlet about Maddie's birth. "They'd told me it would be an eight- to 12-hour labor, and I was ready to have the baby in three to four hours. I had a perfect pregnancy and a perfect delivery. There was no c-section. There were no emergencies. She was perfectly healthy. I had a normal, natural birth. I was very blessed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Maddie gave her mom a brief scare when she didn't cry immediately. "She just looked at me, and she didn't really cry at first," Jamie Lynn told OK! "I was scared, and then she started screaming. It is the best feeling in the whole world."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-her-name-is-meaningful-to-both-her-parents></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Her name is meaningful to both her parents</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jamie Lynn Spears Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spears told the outlet that Aldridge came up with their daughter's first name. "Maddie is a name that Casey thought of, and I really liked it," she told OK!. She also explained that Maddie's middle name, Briann, honors Aldridge's cousin and close friend, Brian, who was killed in a car accident in early June 2008. It's also a nod to Spears' older brother Bryan.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-was-a-very-good-baby></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She was a "very good" baby</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jamie Lynn Spears Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spears and Maddie, whom the proud mom described as a "very good" baby, quickly fell into a routine after her birth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At first, I didn't know how I was going to know when to do what, but it all just falls into place," Spears told OK!. "We get up in the morning, and she gets her little bath. Then I get my bath. We have a routine, and I love routines. I've worked one out with her, and we're happy going about our little life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And though Spears was only 17, she "grasped motherhood immediately and fully," as her mother Lynne later explained to Nylon.

Maddie was submerged underwater for several minutes before she was freed from her seat belt by first responders. As Spears later recalled in her 2022 memoir, Things I Should Have Said, her daughter was unconscious and "eerily blue" when she was pulled out from the water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miraculously, Maddie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>suffered no brain damage and survived</a>. She was released from the hospital after a week, though it would be years before Spears was able to open up about the traumatic event, which she described as a turning point in her life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spears later shared details about the incident <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>on a May 2020 episode of Better Together with Maria Menounos</a>. "We dove in and we were able to rescue her," she said. "When we were finally able to get her out of the water ... and the first responders took her from me, we thought she was gone. We thought we lost our daughter."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That moment, I felt everything that you can feel, I think, as far as the worst," Spears continued. "There's nothing worse than looking at your child and just feeling that you've failed her. And I didn't want her to think that I couldn't save her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of the release of her memoir, where she further discussed the accident and its aftermath, Spears spoke to PEOPLE in January 2022 about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>what she learned after the incident</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you have the worst thing you can think of in your life happen to you, it makes you look at everything else differently. You have a lot more gratitude," Spears said. "That was a miracle. That should be heard. There's a lot of dark things in this world today, and I think that putting something out there like that, that is so wonderful, is something that should be shared, especially when it made so many changes in a lot of lives for the better."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-an-older-sister></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She's an older sister</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jamie Lynn Spears Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maddie became a big sister on April 11, 2018, when Spears and Watson welcomed their first child together, daughter Ivey Joan Watson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Maddie was the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>first one to meet her</a> after she was born," the Sweet Magnolias actress told PEOPLE shortly after Ivey's birth.
