Also, the late NBA legend was the son of <strong>Pamela Cox Bryant</strong> and the former NBA player <strong>Joe Bryant.</strong></p><p>Out of three children, Kobe was the only son, his sisters being <strong>Sharia</strong> and <strong>Shaya Bryant.</strong> The Bryants were practicing Catholics and were extremely religious.</p><p>Ever since a young age, the four times All-Star MVP garnered a love for the sport due to his father and maternal uncle.</p><p>Likewise, he would watch the games his father would play in and would go on emulating him by rolling <strong>Bryant Sr.’s</strong> tube socks and netting in a mini-hoop in his room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kobe-625.jpg><p>The love for Basketball was immense as Kobe started dribbling at the age of 3. Like Bryant said multiple times that he was a “die-hard” Lakers fan, and to be drafted and traded to the Lakers organization and play 20 years there, nobody could write something better than that.</p><p>Upon his father’s retirement, his father moved the family to Italy. While there, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA</a> legend got the opportunity to hone his skills at a lower level. After accustoming to a new lifestyle and tradition, young Kobe became a fan of football as well.</p><p>His all-time favorite is the Rossonero’s, AC Milan. The future gold medallist was an eager learner, and he would showcase his desire by adapting to the situation he got thrown in. Thereby, Kobe became fluent in Italian and Spanish in no time.</p><h2>Kobe Bryant Net Worth | NBA Career: Draft, Salary, & Other Incomes</h2><p>The <strong>Lakers’</strong> main man showed promise from an early age. In fact, Charlotte Hornets first drafted him in 1996 and later traded him to LA Lakers, which marked a glorious history.</p><p>At the age of 17, Kobe had the option to join a college on scholarship; instead, he chose to join the pros. Still a minor, Joe and Pamela had to sign the contract for their son, which was a whopping <strong>$3.5 million</strong> deal that would keep him with the Lakers for three years.</p><p>The youngest player ever to debut for the NBA, KB-8&nbsp; amassed a massive <strong>$328 million</strong> as a salary alone. Playing 20 years in his favorite club, Kobe’s contract extension would grant him a <strong>$90 million</strong> bonus on each extension.</p><p>However, in 2013, the contract extension provided Bryant with only <strong>$48.5 million due to his age</strong>. Call it a chance, call it fate, call it whatever you want, the number 24 had to come into the limelight one way or the other.</p><p>Kobe Bryant deserved all the honors, all the money, and especially love from fans, teammates, and even rivals. While his career ended in 2016, the memories he created for himself and those who watched him will forever get etched in the minds.</p><p>At one point in time, the Black Mamba expressed his desire to leave LA and move to Chicago and sign with the Bulls, but then Lakers’ GM, <strong>Jerry West,</strong> convinced him to stay. Imagine what the future would look like then for both Kobe and the Lakers.</p><p>But here we are a few days after Bryant’s passing and the immortal status he labeled onto his name after four years of retirement. Nonetheless, over the years, he made massive cash from the Lakers.

As a result, he developed a love for the sport and for watching players like Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers and John Battle of the Atlanta Hawks, who helped shape his skill set.</p><h2>Kobe Bryant | Injuries</h2><h3>1999-2000: The First Wrist Injury</h3><p>Before starting the 1999-2000 seasons, Kobe Bryant broke his wrist, which left him missing the first 15 games of Phil Jackson’s first season with the team.</p><p>In his first game back, Kobe notched 19 points and grabbed six rebounds in a win over the Golden State Warriors.</p><h3>2000 NBA Finals: Gripped A Bum Ankle</h3><p>However, Kobe returned for a crucial Game 4 &nbsp;after Shaquille O’Neal fouled out in due time. He took over the game, scoring 28 points, giving the Lakers a recommendable 3-1 series lead.</p><h3>2000-2001: Finest Of Injuries</h3><p>Kobe did not suffer through any of the major attacking injuries this season. He was going well with his run to the second consecutive championship.</p><p>But yes, some hip and elbow bursitis and a sore shoulder and pinky did give him some troubles this season.</p><h3>2003-04: Shoulder Injury</h3><p>Kobe had to drop out of the game in the midway of the year after off-season surgery on his right shoulder.</p><h3>2004-05:&nbsp; Yet Again, The Ankle</h3><p>Kobe missed a month due to his sprained ankle.</p><h3>2007-08: Back Injury</h3><p>Kobe almost lost because of a back injury during the Western Conference semifinals against the Utah Jazz. But however, the giant basketballer had to make it, and he did it, winning the Western Conference titles.</p><h3>The Troubling Injured Finger</h3><p>Kobe played the majority of his seasons with an injured index finger. He utterly felt chopping off the finger rather than dropping out of any game.</p><h3>Ailing Right Knees</h3><p>Before or during 2010, Kobe went to Germany to treat his right knee, which was operated on previously three times.</p><p>He had his knee hurt several times during the 2010 postseason on the way to the Lakers grabbing their second consecutive championship.</p><p>Kobe also revealed that he had been missing some practice sessions due to little cartilage under his ailing knee.</p><h3>The Torn Wrist Ligament</h3><p>Kobe suffered a &nbsp;torn ligament in his shooting wrist in an exhibition game against the&nbsp;Los Angeles Clippers. Just to keep playing, he used to receive pregame injections in his injured wrist.</p><h2>Kobe Bryant Net Worth | Endorsements, Investments, Books & Philanthropic Acts</h2><p>By the end of his career, the Black Mamba made almost<strong> $25 million</strong>. During his playing career and upon retirement, he still had ties to many companies that had endorsement deals with him.</p><p>For instance, Nike, Sprite, McDonald’s, Turkish Airlines, Lenovo, Hublot, and Panini.</p><p>The NBA legend had a huge fan following in China. As a result, China-based endorsement companies like Alibaba, Sina.com, and Mercedes Benz were more than eager to represent Kobe by luring him into a lucrative deal.</p><p>Moreover, when the icon started in 1996, Adidas was the first to include him in a contract that saw Kobe pocket <strong>$48 million</strong> in 6 years. On the other hand, in 2003, when reports of sexual accusations surfaced, many companies terminated their deals indefinitely.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kobe-627.jpg><p>Only Nike was an exception, who, despite the allegations, pulled him into a <strong>$10 million</strong> per year deal that would last for four years. Eventually, after the dark period subsided, many endorsement deals came knocking at Bryant’s doorsteps.</p><p>Furthermore, in 2014, a sports drink named BodyArmour sold 10% of its equity stake for <strong>$6 million</strong> to Kobe. Subsequently, four years later, the company went onto earn <strong>$400 million</strong>.</p><p>At the same time, Coca-Cola stepped in to buy part of the stake. It meant the company’s value was now worth <strong>$2 billion</strong>, ultimately granting Bryant an astonishing <strong>$200k</strong> sum.</p><p>Additionally, by the year 2016, the late legend would venture into the business world. <strong>Jeff Stibel</strong> and Kobe partnered to launch a venture capital company named Bryant-Stibel, which received about <strong>$100 million</strong> in funds.</p><p>These funds would imminently come to use to purchase shares of technology, media, and data-related companies.</p><p>In like manner, to double the cash inflow in the future, Kobe invested in various websites that had the potential to yield a fortune. In particular, The Players Tribune, LegalZoom, Juicero, and Scopely.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kobe-628.jpg><p>Apart from these, Bryant also appeared on the cover for video games like <i>Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA 2K17</a> (Legend Edition; Legend Edition Gold), NBA Courtside 2002, NBA Courtside 2: Featuring Kobe Bryant, NBA 3 On 3 Featuring Kobe Bryant, NBA ’07: Featuring the Life Vol. 2, NBA ’09: The Inside, and NBA 2K10.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Granted that Kobe is famous for his basketball career, he was a movie geek at heart, and in 2018, he narrated, wrote, and produced a short movie titled “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dear Basketball</a>,” his ode to Basketball.</p><p>The movie went on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2019, and Bryant is the only basketball player to win the prestigious accolade.</p><h3>Charitable Works</h3><p>Earning money was not a singular goal for Kobe. As a human, he believed in giving back to society. Although he grew up in a relatively comfortable environment, Bryant knew there were struggles around him.</p><p>Hence, the NBA legend signed on to be the ambassador for After-School All-Stars, an organization aiming to promote after-school programs for children.</p><p>Similarly, Bryant founded the Kobe Bryant China Fund, which works alongside the Soong Ching Ling Foundation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kobe-632.jpg><p>The organization raises money to fund education and health in various provinces in China.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, partnering up with actor <strong>Zach Braff,</strong> the late star presented a considerable $1 million check at the Call of Duty event to provide financial support and aid veterans’ transition to civilian lives.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Black Mamba and his beautiful wife <strong>Vanessa</strong> established <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KVBFF</a>, whose main target was to uplift young generations through sports and transfer the <strong>#MambaMentality</strong> to the youth.</p><p>In the same way, the organization supports homeless people. Kobe was always vocal about such matters and wanted to eradicate the stigma that surrounded homelessness.</p><h3><span id=Books class=mw-headline>Books</span></h3><p>Bryant’s book <strong>The Mamba Mentality: How I Play</strong>, with photographs by Andrew D. Bernstein, an introduction by Phil Jackson, and a foreword by Pau Gasol, was published by MCD / Farrar, Straus, and Giroux on October 23, 2018. Photo essays and his reflections look back on his career.</p><p>When he died, he was working with Brazilian author Paulo Coelho on a children’s book intended to inspire underprivileged children. Coelho deleted the draft after Bryant’s death, saying in an interview that “it didn’t make any sense to publish without him.” He did not specify the number of pages or whether the book had a title.</p><p>Additionally, Bryant has co-written/produced three young adult novels through Granity Studios<strong>: The Wizenard Series: Training Camp, Legacy and the Queen</strong>, and <strong>Epoca: The Tree of Ecrof</strong>. In March 2020, <strong>The Wizenard Series: Season One</strong> was released posthumously. <strong>The Wizenard Series: Season One</strong> topped the New York Times middle-grade hardcover chart.</p><h2>Kobe Bryant Net Worth | Houses & Cars</h2><p>With money comes an ardent desire for sweeter things in life. Well, we can’t blame Kobe for enjoying his life. He didn’t believe in boasting about his wealth, but he made sure to make the most of his life.</p><p>Over the years, the Black Mamba lived an exquisite life and had impeccable car collections. Let’s start with his car collections. Kobe gifted a yellow Lamborghini Murcielago to his wife, Vanessa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kobe-629.jpg><p>This particular model is the only one with an automatic transmission, consisting of a 572 hp, 6.5-liter V12 engine.

Besides, Kobe purchased another Bentley, a convertible Azure Mulliner model.</p><p>His collections include a Ferrari F430 that comes with a 562 hp V8, seven-speed, dual-clutch, and automatic manual transmission in a similar fashion. Another of his Lamborghini fantasies came true; he replaced his Murcielago with the Aventador.</p><p>Even though both models ran on a similar V-12 engine, the latter’s horsepower was quite spectacular. The cars cost him <strong>$505k</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kobe-633.jpg><p>The carbon-fibre chassis comprised all the necessary safety features and officially was an upgrade to his previous possession.
