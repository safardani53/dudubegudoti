The previous episode of the criminal drama was broadcast on February 22, 2022, before the show’s brief hiatus. This week, a new episode named Ambition will premiere. The episode looks promising, according to the trailer and synopsis given by CBS. On March 8, 2022, a new episode will premiere.</span></p><p><span>The show has been on hiatus for several months for several reasons.

There will also be a bomb detonation at the anti-gun lobby.</span></p><p><span>The promo is fast-paced, which could mean a lot will happen in the one-hour timeframe. The blast may take center stage as the crew rushes to uncover the perpetrators. CBS issued the official synopsis around two weeks ago, which reads,</span></p><p><span>“After an anti-gun lobbying building is attacked, the squad investigates a radical gun group; SAC Bashar dangles a possible promotion for OA.”</span></p><p><span>Apart from the compelling case of the radical firearms group, the synopsis teases various subplots that will be vital to the team members. Keith Eisner wrote and directed this episode, which Jean de Segonzac directed.</span></p><h2>When will the next episode of FBI air?</h2><p><span>A new episode of the CBS crime drama will air on Tuesday, March 8, 2022. All of the show’s spin-offs will also return after a one-week hiatus. It will be shown on CBS at 8 p.m. ET. The most recent episode will be released concurrently on the CBS network’s online streaming service, where you can also access all past episodes of the show.</span></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGicqaGjpLGmeZBtZKieXZuvqnnSnpisp55igW6%2BxKWcmquVYrGiwMRmp6unnaR6orrDZqSoqpVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
