He’s been performing from a young age, and his stage presence is unparalleled. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has rounded up everything you need to know about Omar.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>1. Omar got a 4-chair turn.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Omar performed <strong>Journey’s</strong> “Separate Ways” for his Blind Audition. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Legend</strong></a> was the first to turn his red chair, followed by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>, and finally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Camila Cabello</strong></a>. Camila raved that Omar has an “incredibly sick range.” John told Omar that he’s the “kind of artist who can win The Voice.” Omar chose John to be his coach for the season.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Omar is Team Legend’s sole performer still left in the competition. He dazzled during night one of the season 22 finale with his sensational performances of <strong>Michael Jackson’s</strong> “The Way You Make Me Feel” and<strong> Queen’s</strong> “Somebody to Love.”</p><h2>2. Omar is a full-time performer.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Omar told the coaches that he’s performed all over the world — over 20 countries! He also revealed that he hopes to be able to “create a little genre of pop and old-school rock” to suit his voice. Omar has performed for Disney, headlined on cruise ships, and sang background vocals for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jordan Fisher</strong></a>, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NBC bio</a>.</p><h2>3. Omar learned to sing from his mother.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Omar was introduced to singing by his mother, who was the choir director at church. He didn’t sing in front of people until a girl he liked auditioned for the school play. After that, Omar totally embraced theater. He became the lead in the school play and prom king with his girlfriend.</p><h2>4. Omar has become close with the top 10 singers.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>They may be competing against each other to become the next Voice champion, but the top 10 contestants have become friends. “I love these people so much. When i was home sick and not in the best mood they completely changed my day around. It was a great thanksgiving!” Omar wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> about his top 10 contestants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/omar-jose-cardona-5-things-to-know-nbc-embed1.jpg><h2>5.
