Novak</a>, and WNBA's&nbsp;<a href=#>Candace Parker.</a></p><p>Mayim stood tall in a white lab coat with a wide smile with her long hair down and signature specs - now the full look has been revealed hinting she's elevating her style for the celebs.</p><p>"It's the OG&nbsp;Jeopardy, with celebrities," she said in the clip, hilariously shading: "Let's hope they've been reading more than screenplays."</p><p>But on Facebook after the announcement, one slammed: "Am I the only one who has never heard of any of these celebrities? Just Patton Oswalt and Ray Romano."</p><p>Another agreed: "I only know Ray Romano, who are the rest?"</p><h2>'MORE ARE COMING'</h2><p>Luckily for critics, on the podcast <a href=#>Inside Jeopardy!</a>, EP Mike Davies promised last month: "we more coming in on a daily basis.”</p><p>“It’s hard - the celebrities don’t take the test. We don’t interview them so we have to sort of divide who will be good at this game," he added on choosing the stars to play.</p><p>He also teased: "We are introducing a new format for Celebrity Jeopardy!. We’re testing it out, we will be announcing a new format [soon.]"</p><p>“We are gonna be tweaking the format... we will be announcing that in a few weeks.”</p><h2>BIG SHOES TO FILL</h2><p>Celebrity Jeopardy! first aired in 1992, and the last tournament took place in 2015.</p><p>The special has only previously been hosted&nbsp;<a href=#>by the late Alex Trebek, who passed away in 2020</a>&nbsp;from pancreatic cancer at age 80.</p><p>Since its debut, Celebrity Jeopardy! has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">featured</a>&nbsp;over 200 celebrity contestants, including Anderson Cooper, Jodie Foster, Regis Philbin, Pat Sajak, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Stephen King, and so many other household names.</p><p>So famous was the spinoff that it scored the famed&nbsp;<a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>&nbsp;parody skits - some of Will Ferrell’s "most popular" sketches per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;(he of course played an over-it Alex.)</p><p>“I loved them,” Alex once said on the send-ups, per the outlet. “It means you’ve arrived."</p><p>So clearly Mayim has a lot to live up to for fans, but she looks dressed for success.</p><p>Celebrity Jeopardy! will air on Sundays at 8 pm ET on the ABC network and each episode will be available to stream on Hulu one day after it airs.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Mayim&nbsp;also <a href=#>went glasses-free for her first-ever interview</a>&nbsp;with dual host&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48, two weeks, and implied she's upping her fashion game next season.</p><p>Wearing <a href=#>full makeup and her long hair straightened,</a> she said she'll be "looking like this" on tape days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/fans-blast-host-mayim-bialik-747156819-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/fans-shocked-mayim-bialik-debuts-757536913-4.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/coming-abc-multiple-consecutive-night-710946089.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYW2GcYOWaJqepJWXv6rA2Gahnqeglr%2BlxYymmLKhnWKvqq3LoqJmpZGgsrDCxKtkqK2km7a1v4yfpqulkal8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
