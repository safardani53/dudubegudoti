Katie wore a dark, patterned dress, one that was flowy enough to keep her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cool</a> during the hot summer day. Katie’s daughter – who is on her way to being as tall as the Dawson’s Creek alum – was her “Mini-Me,” wearing similarly dark and flowy. However, Suri decided to put her hair in an elegant and very clean braid, while Katie opted to have her hair down.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Both also wore facemasks, since the COVID-19 pandemic is still not over. Katie seemed to coordinate her mask with her outfit, choosing a dark blue one. Suri, on the other hand, showed a bit of a “wild” side, rocking a pink piece of PPE while clutching her cellphone to her chest. While it was unclear where this mother-daughter combo was going, one thing was for sure: they both <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>looked</a> amazing!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/katie-holmes-suri-cruise-floral-dress-match-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>This is not the first time that these two have ‘twinned. It’s also not the first time that these two have matched while Suri was wearing that dress. When the pair were headed for dinner in Manhattan on Aug. 14, Katie wore a black, flower-print dress that matched<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> the same blue-and-brown dress</a> Suri wore on Saturday. Seems that this fashion is a fave of <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tom Cruise’s</a></strong> daughter. The pair were also seen taking their dogs for a walk together in July. Actually, they took their dogs for a “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>carry</a>,” as both Katie and Suri strolled along the sidewalk with their arms wrapped around an adorable pooch. Seems the ground was a little too hot for those bare doggie paws.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Katie and Suri have been spending the summer together, and, from the looks of it, they’ve been having a fun time. “The lockdown has had a lot of silver linings,” Katie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told Entertainment Tonight in July</a>. “This year is a reminder that the simple things are really beautiful. I think when you have less, you are more creative.” Katie said that she has been taking time to “FaceTime” others and “really be there, be present.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/katie-holmes-suri-cruise-floral-dress-match-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Speaking of “present” – or, in this case, “presents” – Katie threw her daughter a homemade birthday bash on April 18. On the day of Suri’s 14th birthday, Katie hand-made the party decorations, which included a crown of roses and signs featuring messages of love. Katie was clearly happy to see her beloved daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>become a young woman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e5FtZqSZpJ6ybrTOpaSeq12owrO1jJyprqGjmnqjuNSeZKytnaKys3nDq5ysq5Woeq%2FFwmanoaekpMBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
