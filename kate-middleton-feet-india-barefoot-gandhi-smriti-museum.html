Not only were Kate’s poor, tired toes left unpolished, her feet also showed major signs of intense issues stemming from wearing high-heels too much. Talk about wear and tear!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But honestly it’s no surprise that Kate left her toes natural, as the Duchess is known to favor an understated look. She only wears neutral shades on her fingernails, for example. What really has us worried though is how she treats her feet and often opts for painful footwear over practical. An expert has even noted that the royal’s feet reveal a few podiatric problems caused by wearing high, pointed heels, according to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>. Yikes!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span id=ext-gen191>“There looks like there may be some rubbing or even the start of a corn on the little toe. You can also see the fourth and fifth toes deviate towards the centre of the foot,” <strong>Dave Wein</strong>, a Podiatrist at Carnation Footcare said about the condition of Kate’s feet. Dave also explained&nbsp;</span>that theses problems are typically caused by wearing super high heels, like the Duchess was wearing that day.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>“This clawed position will normally have been created by pressure from pointed shoes, especially where high heels have delivered excessive pressure on the toes and ball of foot in a pointed toe box,” he said. It’s also obvious from photos that Kate has a relatively&nbsp;low arch, which can lead to even more problems when high heels are worn too often.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>[jwplatform z6KGUnoB]</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><br><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“This flattening of the long arch of the foot can be associated with pain in the feet, ankles and knees,” Dave revealed. “It can also lead to extra pressure as the feet go through there normal walking motion and have to roll in too much – known as excessive pronation – to push off to the next step.” Wow, it definitely appears that Kate is in pain! And while we totally understand&nbsp;that it’s difficult for women who are in the pubic eye, like the Duchess, to wear ultra sensible footwear, we do think Kate would be MUCH better off in the long run if she introduced a few flats into her wardrobe rotation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>What do you think of Kate’s feet, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Do they convince you to abstain from heels?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH11e5BqZqSZpJp6rrXDnaOerJ%2BjeqexxK1koqaUnq5ursCrnJ%2Bnn6l6qK3NnZ%2BiZaOiv6rAyGakrquVqrpw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
