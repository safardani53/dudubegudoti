We are using a surrogate and she’s fallen pregnant at the first attempt.</p><p>“Our surrogate, Marie, is a lady from San Francisco we have worked with previously for our agency, the British Surrogacy Centre.</p><p>“This will be her last surrogacy and she wanted to do it for Scott and I.” They chose the egg donor based on her “gorgeous” looks and high IQ.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/36aa4e77-d6f8-43f2-8093-9fffc136f946.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000539838564.jpg><p>Barrie said: “We found a beautiful, young, educated egg donor before the surrogate.</p><p>“We met 15 egg donors at the Beverly Wiltshire hotel, the hotel in the film Pretty Woman.</p><p>“We decided that would make the perfect setting to find the woman who would add the part of the DNA for our baby girl."</p><p>Tony, 55, who was with Barrie for 32 years, has no plans to divorce and is living in a separate wing of their £6million home.</p><p>He is said to be “delighted” at the new additions to their “very modern family”, although he hasn't commented on it on his own Instagram page.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000385437885.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000385437883.jpg><p>Tony and Barrie’s first children were twins Saffron and Aspen.</p><p>“Our family has too many boys and too much testosterone! So we used sex selection to even things out. We know we are having girls,” he added.</p><p>Now he and Scott are shopping to furnish a Burberry-themed £100,000 nursery for this daughter, described as “the ultimate princess palace”.</p><p>Barrie said: “We are thrilled we are going to become daddies again.</p><p>“Tony is excited too, although it does underline that our marriage really is over after all these years, so it is very bittersweet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000539540583.jpg><p>“But we are all going to remain living under the same roof. Tony is Dad, I’m Daddy and while at the moment Scott is stepdad, soon he’s going to be Daddy Two.</p><p>“We are happy, we want to co-parent our kids and that’s all that matters. If people don’t get it, that’s their problem, not ours.”</p><p>The pair, who are worth a combined £40million from various business ventures including a global research company, used their experience having Saffron and Aspen to set up their own surrogacy agency in 2000.</p><p>They then welcomed son Orlando in 2003 and twins Jasper and Dallas in 2010. Tony and Barrie don’t know who is the father of which child — and some have different egg donors — meaning potentially they are not biologically linked to the kids.</p><p>And the mind-boggling connections between the siblings will become even more confusing with Scott and Barrie’s daughter, as they have decided they don’t want to know which of them is the biological father.</p><p>Even though Saffron, a make-up entrepreneur, had dated Scott, she has given their relationship her blessing. She said last December: “As long as they’re happy, I’m not bothered.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>We previously told you about the<a href=#> couple's flash engagement during their holiday to Hvar.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Previously, daughter Saffron was trolled by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cruel bullies who mocked her lip fillers online</a>.</p><p>And she is no stranger to fabulous shopping sprees...&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">look at her here.</a></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>One of Britain’s first gay dads, Barrie Drewitt-Barlow, reveals he’s fathered 17 kids during secret life as an ‘international sperm donor’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BrbnFpaGV%2BcMHKZp2iqqOpeqit2GabmpxdrLKtr86mnKxlkpavunnDmqygoKSav26x12g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
