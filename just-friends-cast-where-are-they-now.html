The cast of Just Friends has kept audiences laughing for more than 15 years after the film — which showed <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a> as overweight teen-turned-womanizer, Chris Brander — initially hit theaters in 2005.</p><p>In the <a href=#>rom-com</a>, Chris is reunited with <a href=#>his high school best friend</a>, Jamie Palamino (<a href=#><strong>Amy Smart</strong></a>), after finding himself stuck at home for the holidays.</p><p>When Chris’s flight to Paris with singer Samantha James (<a href=#><strong>Anna Faris</strong></a>) gets rerouted to New Jersey following a plane fire, he is forced to <a href=#>face his former crush</a> — who told him as a teenager that <a href=#>she wasn’t interested in him romantically</a> — and another high school pal, Dusty Dinkleman (<a href=#><strong>Chris Klein</strong></a>), who also loved Jamie.</p><p>Chris’ insecurities of being the rejected fat kid creep in when Dusty makes a move on Jamie in front of him. Meanwhile, Chris is stuck with caring for Samantha who is obsessed with him and whom he wants nothing to do with.</p><p><strong>Chris Marquette</strong>, who played Mike Brander, <a href=#>celebrated this film’s 15-year anniversary</a> with a throwback photo from the comedy in November 2020.</p><p>“Happy anniversary #justfriends,” he wrote alongside a snap of Faris’ character prying information from him.</p><p>Marquette joked, “You’ll always be fat to me @vancityreynolds,” before noting how “grateful” he was to be a part of the movie. “Was a blast to work with the master of rom-com @rogerkumble and the extraordinarily talented @smarthouse26 @annafaris @iamchrisklein,” he added.</p><p>Reynolds, for his part, <a href=#>paid homage to his character’s iconic musical moment</a> in which he sings “I Swear” by All-4-One, while making his TikTok debut in June 2021.</p><p>“I swear you will be disappointed by this account,” <a href=#>the Deadpool star</a> jokingly captioned his first video, which showed him doing a lip-sync to the track.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Reynolds embodied his rom-com character as he sang to the screen in a similar fashion to the way that Chris belted out the song in his mirror during the beginning of the movie. In the film, Chris gave a passionate performance while thinking about his crush, which included spirit finger moves that Reynolds also reenacted in his video.</p><p>Scroll down to see what the main cast of Just Friends has been up to since 2005:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BfwrTAjJ%2Bpop2emcBur8Csq2avmJq%2FpnnAq5xmrJiaxm66zrBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
