Apart from the two of them, many other pro wrestlers joined the team, notably Spike Dudley.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, the Dudley family consisted of many illegitimate children of “Big Daddy” Dudley as part of the portrayal.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As the WWE owned the rights to their names, the Dudley brother became known as Brother Ray and Brother Devon after joining TNA (Total Nonstop Action Wrestling).</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition, they got the team name Team 3D because of their finishing move called Dudley Death Drop. Also, Bubba changed his name to Bully during his TNA career.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After a brief conflict with each other, whether it was real or scripted, Devon and Bully reunited as part of Aces and Eights.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bully Ray And Devon</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The rise of half-brothers, Bully Ray and Devon, began in Extreme Championship Wrestling. Together, the half-brothers won the ECW World Tag Team Champions eight times.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After joining the WWF/WWE, they became the World Tag Team Championships’ eight-time winners.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, the Dudley brothers won the National Wrestling Alliance World Tag Team Championship after joining TNA.

In 1995, LoMonaco entered a tryout session with Extreme Championship Wrestling.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After his impressive tryout, the then- ECW owner hired Mark and was recast as Buh Buh Ray Dudley of the Dudley Family.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 1999, Buh Buh Ray and his half-brother, D-Von (Hughes), left ECW to join the World Wrestling Federation, where the spelling “Buh Buh” changed to “Bubba.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Dudley-Boyz.webp><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2002, the Dudley brothers left WWE and joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. However, none of them restrained from using “Dudley” in their names.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Later, Bubba and D-Von were legally instructed not to use the trademark name, which led the brothers to take legal action. The Dudley brothers were forced to change their ring names as the rights of the name were under WWE.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It was in May 2011 that LoMonaco renamed himself Bully Ray, after defeating Amazing Red.&nbsp;</span></p><p>On May 8, 2015, Ray made an appearance as the special guest referee for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Kurt Angle and Eric Young in an episode of Impact Wrestling.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, Bully Ray and D-Von made a surprise appearance in the WWE, restoring the Dudley Boyz tag team persona in the episode of RAW on August 24, 2015.</span></p><p>After competing in the Ring of Honor for 3 years, Ray left the show as his contract expired on April 1, 2020.</p><p>Ray made an appearance as the special guest commentator for the NWA World Women’s Championship on June 11, 2022, and on the June 14 episode of NWA Powerr, the Hall of Famer was attacked by Mike Knox and VSK.</p><p>Bully made his return to Impact Wrestling at Bound for Glory on October 7, 2022, where he won the Intergender Call Your Shot Gauntlet.</p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hall of Fame</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After the feud between Carters, it was announced on the Slammiversary night that Bully would be inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2014. However, he was not the only one to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Along with his brother, Devon, Bully would be called to the TNA Hall of Fame as Team 3D for Bound for Glory.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bubba-During-His-WWE-Career.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, Team 3D defeated Tommy Dreamer and Abyss at Bound for Glory on their last contract date. After the end of the contract, Ray made a special appearance as a guest referee for the TNA heavyweight championships.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, in mid-2015, Bully Ray left the company as he was not happy with the current state of affairs.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Broadcasting Career At Sirius XM</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After dominating the wrestling world, LoMonaco is currently a co-host for Busted Open at Sirius XM Holdings Inc.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sirius XM is a well-known American broadcasting company in New York City with branches outside of the U.S. as well.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Busted Open is one of the few recognized shows covering all PRO WRESTLING from Monday to Saturday.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>With his energetic power of speech and field experience, he might also dominate the broadcasting aspect of wrestling.</span></p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Heated Debate</span></h4><p>In December 2022, in a recent episode of the podcast ‘Busted Open,’ WWE Hall of Famer Bully Ray stormed off the podcast after getting into a heated argument with his co-host, Tommy Dreamer.</p><p>Bully Ray co-hosted the podcast along with ECW legend Tommy Dreamer, <a href=# rel=noopener>Mark Henry</a>, and Dave LaGreca as the lead host of the Busted Open podcast on SiriusXM Fight Nation channel 156.</p><p>The argument started when Ray and Dreamer hosted the podcast together in the absence of LaGreca, and the WWE Hall of Famer accused Dreamer of trying to do his job as lead host after Dreamer announced a break.</p><p>After the break, Ray seemed furious as Dreamer welcomed listeners back. The ECW legend started to talk about a subject but was interrupted by Ray.</p><p>Bully Ray said, “Time out. Time out. Just so you know. When LaGreca is not here, I’m the lead host of the show. You’re the co-host of the show and you do a damn fine job. But do me a favor, don’t do my job for me. Ok, so I’ll tell what, why don’t you take this segment and why don’t you do it by yourself as I thought would happen at the top of the show, one of us is gonna get annoyed. So I’m annoyed first.
