I like to wash and chop and measure for the cook and clean as they go. I’m better at the eating part of meals.</p><p>2. My favorite book of all time is Lolita.</p><p>3. I can salsa dance on stilts.</p><p>4. My mother is the most influential person in my life. Her name is Mary, but her friends call her Pat, and my [late] dad called her Jess.</p><p>5. I’ve had two dogs, both pugs — Rose Kennedy and Mac. I loved Mac the best.</p><p>6. I’m excellent at sewing. I used to sew with my mom. She’d sew outfits for me and I’d sew little versions for my dolls.</p><p>7. The best splurge I ever made was on a private skydiving lesson on the Costa Brava in Spain.</p><p>8. If I weren’t an actress, I’d love to be writing a novel.</p><p>9. I have a temper, which I always regret losing.</p><p>10. I’d cast [former News-Radio costar] <strong>Dave Foley</strong> to play me in a movie about my life because he’s funny and looks good in a dress.</p><p>11. I don’t ever let anyone else do my laundry. I find laundry very relaxing. I like to go to laundromats in foreign countries.</p><p>12. I have a mantra because I do Transcendental Meditation. You’re not supposed to tell anyone what it is, and I never have. I think it’s the only secret I’ve never told anyone.</p><p>13. The last thing I do before I go to sleep is worry about not sleeping.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Maura-Tierney-The-Affair.jpg><p>14. I don’t believe in the phrase “guilty pleasure.” Why should people feel guilty about being happy?</p><p>15. My first celebrity crush was <strong>Paul Michael Glaser</strong>. I was allowed to stay up late on Wednesday nights to watch Starsky and Hutch.</p><p>16. Last week when I was running in Hudson River Park, a man jogged up next to me and asked for a selfie — while we were running! I declined.</p><p>17. The one item I couldn’t live without is my headlamp.</p><p>18. My first job was working in a deli. I smelled like pickles literally all the time.</p><p>19. I’m obsessed with tiny things.</p><p>20. In L.A., I drive my dad’s 1982 Mercedes convertible. I love it because I think about him every time I start the car.</p><p>21. I like to shovel snow if it’s not freezing out.</p><p>22. I work with a New York avant-garde theater company called the Wooster Group and have toured all over the world with them.</p><p>23. I can chop wood.</p><p>24. I’ve never watched a reality show. Ever.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25.
