In addition to shotput, the athlete competed in track and field.</span></p><p><span>Jason has always been sporty and active since he was a child who grew even more with years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Serena Williams’s Sisters: Bio, Murder & Mother >></a></strong></p><h3><span>Educational Background&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Jason went to Archbishop Mitty High School. There the athlete participated in a variety of sports. At the same time, he worked part-time at Milipitas Health and Fitness as a front desk representative.</p><p><span>Likewise, after graduating from high school, Jason later attended Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California. Surprisingly</span><span>, he did not participate in any of the sports organized by his university. </span><span>Instead, the athlete returned to full-time employment at Milipitas Health and Fitness.</span></p><p><span>For his first CrossFit competition, he trained from the same gym. H</span><span>e also earned a Bachelor of Arts in Business Management from college in 2007.</span></p><h3><span>Family</span></h3><p><span>Khalipa has kept a low profile when it comes to his family. The CrossFit athlete is the son of <strong>Robert Khalipa</strong>, whereas not much is known about his mother. </span><span>Jason once stated in a Twitter comment that his mother is from Italy and his father is from Iran.</span></p><p><span>Also, he has a sister who is from an athlete background too. He once uploaded a photo of himself and his sister on Instagram, claiming they had met their training goal.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps the sportsman doesn’t want the media to bother his family, so he keeps his personal life private.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Russell Wilson: Early Life, Fitness, Marriage, Kids & Net Worth >></strong></a></p><h2><span>Jason Khalipa: Height, Weight, and Ethnicity</span></h2><p><span>As expected, Khalipa has a muscular and athletic physique. Jason has a towering height of 5’8″ and weighs 98 kilograms.</span></p><p><span>The athlete’s eyes are hazel brown, and his hair is dark brown to add more about his exterior features. This American citizen has a highly charismatic physical look.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Jason Khalipa: </span>Personal Life&nbsp;</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jason is married to&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ashley Khalipa</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, with whom he has two lovely daughters. The lovely couple met during high school and have been friends ever since.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As a result, they’ve known each other for quite some time.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/khalipa-family-stanford-childrens.jpg><p><span>The two later turned their friendship into a relationship. He did, however, propose to Ashley much later in life. </span><span>Finally, they got married on July 18, 2009, in a private ceremony, including their friends and family.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, in 2012, the couple welcomed their daughter, <strong>Ava Khalipa</strong>. The athlete is, in fact, a family man. He spends most of his time with his family when he isn’t working out.</span></p><p><span>The family spends a lot of time at their house in Los Gatos. </span><span>Jason also cooks healthy meals for his family at home, of course, inspired by his wife.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Heidi Andersson Bio: Arm Wrestling, Family & Barn >></a></strong></p><h3><span>Daughter’s Deteriorating Health</span></h3><p>Khalipa’s daughter Ava was diagnosed with leukemia in 2016. Ava was just four years old when she was first diagnosed.</p><p><span>As their daughter fought to overcome this condition, Jason and his wife Ashley stood by her side with unshakable positivity and strength. </span><span>As a matter of fact, the athlete gave up competitive CrossFit to focus on his daughter.</span></p><p><span>Following Ava’s final treatment in 2018, the couple has devoted their efforts to raising awareness for children with cancer.</span></p><p><span>In fact, the two teamed up with the NEGU team to assist families in similar situations. Ava’s Kitchen, an annual charity event, was also started by them. </span><span>They also organized the west coast’s largest non-affiliated blood drive.</span></p><h2><span>Jason Khalipa: Professional Career</span></h2><p><span>In 2008, Khalipa began his professional fitness career. Before his retirement, the athlete competed in eight CrossFit Games tournaments.</span></p><p><span>In the 2008 Championship, he won his first CrossFit game and then qualified for the 2009 CrossFit Games as a champion. </span><span>Jason came in fifth place that year. </span><span>However, the athlete did receive the title of “Spitiy of the Games.”</span></p><p><span>Following that, Jason continued to take first place in the CrossFit games from 2010 through 2015. He was also the World Champion on one occasion.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jk.jpg><p><span>In 2015, the athlete competed in a team competition with his NorCol Crossfit unit.&nbsp;</span><span>Jason returned for training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in 2016. That year, he won the US Open Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competition in the adult 208 lb division.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Following that, in 2017, the athlete competed in the 2017 CrossFit Games for a short time. But, after one tournament, he withdrew.</span></p><h3><span>Other Endeavours</span></h3><p><span>The athlete built his first gym, <strong>CrossFit Santa Clara</strong>, after winning the first CrossFit games in 2008. </span><span>In 2011, he changed the name of the gym to <strong>NorCla CrossFit</strong>. As an affiliate of the NorCla, he even competed in team CrossFit games.</span></p><p><span>The gym was renamed again <strong>NCFIT</strong> in 2017. Jason also announced the gym’s disaffiliation from the CrossFit brand later in 2020.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/crossfit-founder-uni.jpg><p><span>As the athlete’s fame in the fitness world expanded, he published “As Many Reps As Possible” in 2019. T</span><span>his book chronicled his career as a fitness athlete and as an integral part of the CrossFit Games winner.</span></p><p><span>Jason is also the host of the podcast AMRAP Mentality and Business of Fitness. </span><span>In addition, the athlete is a cancer ambassador for children.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Jason Khalipa: Social Media&nbsp;</span></h2><p>If you desire to have a closer look into Khalipa’s life, then don’t forget to follow him on social media.
