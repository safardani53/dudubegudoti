According to a recent source, the picture has officially surpassed one million moviegoers in its brief theatrical run beginning January 26, 2022. This astounding achievement has made The Pirates 2, 2022 the first Korean film to be seen by over one million people. While this is an incredible feat, what makes it even more astounding is that Korean cinemas are still subject to severe COVID-19 standards.&nbsp;Social distancing rules basically cut a film’s profit potential in half. Thus, the film’s great success speaks volumes about the film’s director, Kim Jung-hoon, and the outstanding actors who went through a difficult experience to produce the picture.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pirates-2-2.jpg alt="Pirates 2" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>The Pirates 2 had to be shot in the middle of winter.</h2><p>While filming started in the summers, the film’s production timeline was first pushed back by the COVID-19 epidemic. As they tried to resume shooting, the torrential rains once again thwarted their intentions.&nbsp;According to Jung-hoon, this only left them with the winter season and the task of overcoming the terrible cold in order to finish the shooting. This was made more challenging by the fact that The Pirates 2 has several sequences in the sea, particularly underwater. Jung-hoon said that shooting these moments was far more difficult than it seems and that it became an inconceivable chore for both the actors and the crew.</p><p>“Because the performers can’t do anything while they’re buried in water, it’s pointless for a director to attempt to give them orders.” I’m extremely appreciative to the performers who were able to act even when submerged.”</p><p>“During shooting, Park Ji Hwan caught the water in his ear and had a middle ear infection.” Kang Ha Neul got water in his nose and had to go to the hospital to get it out. When I screamed ‘cut,’ Lee Kwang Soo and Han Hyo Joo would spit up water. That’s how difficult it was for everyone. “The production crew that was helping also went through a lot.”</p><p>The Pirates 2 is a spiritual sequel to the successful film The Pirates, which was released in 2014. The action-adventure comedy follows a motley crew of pirates on adventures in the seas in search of missing riches that have vanished without a trace.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioqVdn7KwusZmn6innmLBorjKrGSamp%2BqwW6yyKWkoqaXYsGpsYypoKuZpJrAbn6MoqVmrJiaeqWxwJ1kqJ5drLavwMSrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
