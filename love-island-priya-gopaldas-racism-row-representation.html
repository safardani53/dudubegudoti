No, dropping someone in a week before the final is tokenism, it doesn't count," she added.</p><p>She went on to hit out against claims that it was "impossible to represent all ethnicities on the show".</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more on love island">read more on love island</h2><p>Posting the 2021 population census, Priya added: "Asians make up the 2nd highest proportion of the UK population, so should be represented appropriately."</p><p>It comes after Love Island fans called out the series once again for the <a href=#>lack of diversity in the original line-up</a>.</p><p><a href=#>The first 10 islanders</a>&nbsp;were revealed this week, sparking concern among fans who feel the show is lacking in people of colour, age range and body type.</p><p>In fact, some of them are being considered almost carbon copies of former contestants.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Love Island</h2></p><p>Of the new contestants, only three are Black or mixed race, with no other ethnicities represented, and none of them are plus-size or differ in figure.</p><p>While more islanders will be added throughout the series run, fans have flocked to social media to demand wider representation of UK singletons as a whole, including South and East Asian representation.</p><p>"Maybe it’s just the photos but the OG cast doesn’t look as diverse this year which is a bummer," wrote one fan.</p><p>"The starting lineup is always so bland, it's just the same type of people as the seasons before," said a second. "It would be nice to see some more Asians, maybe some ginger/ light brown white girls, curvier women, perhaps some men with different body types."</p><p>"There are only 2 black contestants and one mixed contestant in the cast where is the diversity hmm," added a third.
