She was born on August 21st, 1974.</p><p>When she moved to the East Coast, Cas started to teach at Syracuse University, but now she is a professor at&nbsp;Rhode Island School of Design in the Industrial Design department.</p><p>Hope, Rhode Island has become home for Cas. She took an abandoned summer camp and transformed it into her toy workshop where she dreams up all her designs and executes them.</p><p>In 2006, Cas founded the toy company Heroes Will Rise.</p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SEE ALSO</a>:</strong></span> Interior Design Masters: Abigail Ahern age, Instagram, and career!</li></ul><h3>Cas’ toy designs</h3><p>In the Abstract: The Art of Design episode, Cas says: “When I design toys I want children to create from their imagination rather than following instructions… My work as a designer is to give them these tools so that they are free to imagine, explore ideas and invent new things.”</p><p>Her first successful toy design was Geemo, a building toy which was launched at the Museum of Modern Art’s design store in 2006.</p><p>But it was Rigmajig which really launched Cas’ career.</p><p>Rigmajig is a large-scale building kit which was initially created for a pop-up at the launch of New York’s High Line Park back in 2011. It was such a success that it was commissioned to be designed for schools and playgrounds. Then Cas started to sell Rigmajig for families in their homes.</p><p>Find out more about Rigmajig on&nbsp;<span style=text-decoration:underline><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>.</span></p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">READ MORE</a>:</strong></span> Styling Hollywood: Who is John Mumblo?
