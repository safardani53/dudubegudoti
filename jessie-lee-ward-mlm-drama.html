Jessie Lee Ward faces abuse allegations…</h2><p>On the first day of the trip, the group had a gay old time. However, things took a turn for the worst on what was supposed to be a two-hour hike. It wasn’t until later that participants learned that the trip would actually take a total of 15 hours.</p><p>This was an issue for one of the hikers, who had diabetes. This group member was forced to opt out of the hike, and was later evaluated by a medic.</p><p>Jessie later admitted that she intentionally lied about where they were headed to build character.

In a lengthy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post, she doubled down on her methods.</p><p>“I absolutely made them walk 10 miles in direct sunlight without telling them where we would end up sleeping on a beach instead of the 12-bedroom villa,” she wrote in the post, adding that the group members who struggled to complete the hike were “at fault for not preparing themselves.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“Pain is in your mind,” her post continued.
