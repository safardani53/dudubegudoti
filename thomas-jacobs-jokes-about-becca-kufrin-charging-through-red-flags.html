After several Bachelor Nation fans (and even the former&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Bachelorette</a>&nbsp;</i>season 17 lead) called out <a href=#><strong>Thomas Jacobs</strong></a> for his “red flags,” he has gotten in on the joke.</p><p class=p1>The California native, 29, teased girlfriend<a href=#> <strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a> via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Sunday, October 31, after she shared footage of <a href=#>the couple’s Halloween costume</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bachelor-in-paradises-thomas-jacobs-jokes-about-gf-becca-kufrin-charging-through-red-flags.gif?w=600&quality=86&strip=all"><p class=p1>The former Bachelorette, 31, shared a clip via her social media page of the pair transitioning their everyday clothes into<a href=#> their couples’ costumes</a>, captioning it, “Olé #happyhalloween&nbsp;#matador&nbsp;#bullfight.”</p><p class=p1>Jacobs, who was dressed as a bull to his love’s matador, replied to her post, “Charging through all my red flags like,” which seemingly referenced her previous callout about his alleged relationship dealbreakers.</p><p class=p1>The drama initially started back in June when <a href=#><strong>Katie Thurston</strong></a> warned the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>&nbsp;</i>season 7 cast not to date her former suitor, who was accused of <a href=#>going on her season to become the next lead</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I am nervous for any woman who interacts with Thomas, honestly. He’s a smooth talker,” the Washington native, 30, said on the “Viall Files” podcast at the time. “I <a href=#>wouldn’t be surprised if he recycles some lines with me</a> on some of these women. … Good luck to them. If he’s on&nbsp;<i>Paradise</i>, I don’t care who he’s with, I’m going to be like, ‘Watch out, girl.’”</p><p class=p1>Months later, the former publicist shared a snap with Jacobs on the&nbsp;<i>BiP</i>&nbsp;beach in September before a social media user commented, “This guy has ‘red flags’ written all over him.”</p><p class=p1>The Minnesota native replied, “<a href=#>Red is my favorite color.</a>”</p><p class=p1>While the Bourdon founder eventually broke up with Jacobs during <a href=#>the October finale of the reality TV show</a>, the pair later reconciled after filming wrapped.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“We had a great time together and I would say it was smooth sailing for those weeks that we spent on the beach together, which was incredible to start a relationship, but for me, to leave a third time with somebody I really had to know who I would be leaving with,” the “Bachelor Happy Hour” podcast cohost <a href=#>recalled on an episode of the “Talking It Out With Bachelor Nation” podcast earlier this month</a>. “I was like, I see this positive fun-loving, supportive great guy, but to make a relationship, there’s going to be hard times and I wanted to see how he would get through adversity or handle any hiccup in the road, and I didn’t get to see that on my time really in&nbsp;Paradise.”</p><p class=p1>Since they’ve rekindled their romance, the duo has continued to grow closer and even <a href=#>spent time with one another’s dogs</a>. Kufrin even noted via Instagram on&nbsp;Wednesday, October 27,&nbsp;that she “[loved] this life with” her beau, alongside a sweet selfie of the two of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJ%2BirrR5yZqaqJqjYrewt8SsZJqan6rBbq7EnJqaZZuqs7O1zWaaoZminLavs4ytn6unpZy1br7EnWSfpJGcwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
