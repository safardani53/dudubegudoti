It also lets in UV light for the plants inside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/80c9af08-5177-467d-8cfc-ef5ae5c7e16a.jpg><h2>Where is the Eden Project?</h2><p>The project is located in a reclaimed&nbsp;china clay&nbsp;pit, 1.2&nbsp;miles from the town of&nbsp;St Blazey, near&nbsp;St Austell in Cornwall.</p><p>The nearest station is St Austell where you can catch a bus to the site.</p><h2>How much did the Eden Project cost?</h2><p>Overall the&nbsp;Eden Project cost&nbsp;£141million to complete.</p><p>The build was funded through a series of government grants and loans, from institutions like the Millennium Commission – with funding coming from the National Lottery – and European regeneration funds.</p><p>Since it was fully funded in 2000, the site has been a source of enormous economic revitalisation for Cornwall and the Southwest as a whole – it is believed to have contributed well over £1 billion to the local economy since its launch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000470775288.jpg><h2>How do I get tickets for the Eden Project?</h2><p>All visits require pre-booking with a timed entry ticket at the moment.</p><p>You can pre-book tickets up until September 5, with more dates to follow.</p><p>Entries are staggered with time ticketing slots so as to ensure social distancing measures are adhered to.</p><p>Your chosen time slot gives you a window of 30 minutes in which to arrive, but once inside, you’re welcome to stay all day.</p><p>Entry tickets are annual passes. An annual pass gives you unlimited entry to Eden for a whole year (from the selected date) – and also allows the Eden Project to treat your admission fee as a donation to the charity.</p><h2>Is the Eden Project coming to Morecambe?</h2><p>A planning application for an Eden project to be built up north in Morecambe, Lancashire, is to be put in during summer 2021, it has been announced.</p><p>The application, which has cost more than £1m to put together, could be with Lancaster City Council in the summer months, according to&nbsp;Eden Project North&nbsp;architect Tim Narey, <a href=#>Lancs Live</a> reports.</p><p>In an open public forum with&nbsp;Morecambe&nbsp;residents, Narey explained that the vast environmental impact assessment, attached to the planning application, would take several months to put together before the project could move forward.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>Narey said: "We are marching quite quickly towards getting the planning application into the council this summer.</p><p>"Because of the complexity of this application we have to do an environmental impact assessment, we like that we have to do it because it teaches about all the amazing things in Morecambe we may not have known about before.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"We are still very committed here and the planning application will cost well over £1m; it is a huge piece of work."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Kate giggles when confronted by a dinosaur puppet at the Eden Project</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoJzgJBtb25np52utXnIrGStoJVisqWxzWanq6eamrC1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
