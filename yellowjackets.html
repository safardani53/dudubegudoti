Most recently, Christina recently wrapped production on&nbsp;Percy&nbsp;opposite Christopher Walken.  She was most recently seen on the Amazon critically acclaimed series,&nbsp;Z, about the love affair between Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Christina optioned the material and put the show together functioning as both Executive Producer and star.   &nbsp;</p><p>Some of her more critically acclaimed roles include&nbsp;Black Snake Moan, from director Craig Brewer,&nbsp;Monster&nbsp;starring opposite Academy Award winner Charlize Theron, &nbsp;The Ice Storm&nbsp;for director Ang Lee and&nbsp;The Opposite of Sex&nbsp;for director Don Roos. &nbsp;</p><p>She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, an American Comedy Award, and an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress for her work in&nbsp;The Opposite of Sex,&nbsp;and earned a National Board of Review Best Supporting Actress Award for her combined efforts in&nbsp;The Opposite of Sex,&nbsp;Buffalo 66&nbsp;and John Water's&nbsp;Pecker.

Additionally, Ricci starred opposite Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's&nbsp;Sleepy Hollow,&nbsp;for which she won the Blockbuster Entertainment Award. </p><p>Ricci's performance at age 7 in a school Christmas play caught the attention of a local theatre critic, who suggested to her parents that she consider an acting career. She made her professional acting debut one year later in&nbsp;Mermaids&nbsp;in the pivotal role of Cher's youngest daughter and Winona Ryder's sister.  As a child actor, Ricci won over audiences and critics alike with her winning portrayal of the strangely adorable Wednesday Addams in&nbsp;The Addams Family.&nbsp;Her performance so delighted the film's creators and movie fans that Ricci was given an expanded role in the sequel,&nbsp;Addams Family Values. She went on to star in the surprise hit of the summer 1995 season Casper.
