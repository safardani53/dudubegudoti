Not that that's a bad thing — the Fury actor is incredibly easy on the eyes and, according to stepmother <strong>Dina Eastwood</strong>, as great on the inside as he is on the outside.&nbsp;</p><p>Dina, who recently separated from Scott's dad after 17 years of marriage, has known the hunky rising star since he was just a little boy. And to say that she adores him is an understatement.</p><p>"He is an amazing young man!" she gushes to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>. "He has had nothing handed to him — ever. He works as a bartender when he is not acting. He has to pay the bills!"</p><p>(Indeed, the younger Eastwood told Town & Country that he's worked hard to support himself. "People assumed that I would have everything handed to me, but that couldn't be further from the truth. I was on my own just doing the grind," he said of his past work experience, which also includes stints as a construction worker and valet.)</p><p>That's not to say he doesn't have time for fun, though. Dina tells <strong>Us</strong> he's a very well-rounded young man, with varied interests and many talents.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"He is as good as a pro in surfing," she brags, noting that he's also an "excellent golfer and all-around athlete." He's a music fanatic, too, she says, and can play "a little piano and saxophone."</p><p>Moreover, "he cherishes family and friends and is always the first one to keep us all in touch," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. (Dina is "very close" not just with Scott but also with his sister, Katie, and their mom, Jaclyn Reeves.) "Can you tell I worship this kid?" she quips.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasm5%2BpwW6xwKyrsKefmcBuv9Oep6anpJ2ys3nDoqWaZZWWwLXDzqibZq%2Bfp8Cptc%2BsZKGhnWJ%2FcX2SanByZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
