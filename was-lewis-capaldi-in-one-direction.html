After all, in the past, Lewis has made jokes and comments about reuniting the group. In fact, there was a time that Lewis's song "Pointless" went number one in the U.K.</p><p>"So many people have told me this song sounds like it should've been a One Direction song and now I'm thinking about all the money I could've made if only I had written it in 2014," he wrote in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok video</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Niall Horan (@niallhoran)</a></p></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC</a> also reported that the musical Scottsman told his pal Niall Horan, who is also a former One Direction frontman, to "round up the troops at once," but those words apparently didn't yield much results. Safe to say that Lewis wasn't a member of One Direction, after all. sigh!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">One Direction charmed Britain and the entire world with their music.</h2><p>Now, we'll let you in on a little secret: there's nothing more fascinating than a group of British guys with the vocal tenacity to match their likable music and overall vibe.

Their music became the soundtrack to a generation, and their impact on pop culture and the supercharged teenage girl-boy-crazy era is unarguable. From stadium tours to sold-out concerts, they were a phenomenon that took the world by storm. And while they may have embarked on their individual paths, their loyal fanbase continues to support them through thick and thin.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lewis is taking a break from music â€” here's why.</h2><p>Beyond his music, Lewis has been known to be a down-to-earth personality and has been candid and vulnerable about his mental health struggles, particularly with <a href=#>Tourette Syndrome</a>, a nervous system disorder involving repetitive movements. The syndrome is triggered in childhood and involves uncontrollable repetitive movements.</p><p>Lewis recently took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> to share with fans that he wouldn't be touring "for the foreseeable future" because of the condition.
