He was my best friend and it's hard to<br>believe what happened.</p><p>"Only an hour earlier we had been in town together and took a photograph of him, it's hard to accept."</p><p>His elder brother Mohammad, 19, said: "Anas was one of six brothers and we are all in disbelief.</p><p>"The family came here from Daraa in Syria three years ago and had found a new life which Anas was enjoying and was doing well.

Thinking of all his family and friends today."</p><p>And Ella Boo Barton added: "RIP Anas, died a hero."</p><p>Fiona Jenkinson said: "Poor lad. Thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. RIP Anas."</p><h2>'ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY'</h2><p>Fran Wood, Chair of Darlington Assistance for Refugees, said the charity was supporting the boy's devastated family.</p><p>She said: "It's an absolute tragedy. It's not the first time the family have seen tragedy.</p><p>"The key worker who has been working with the family has done an amazing job.</p><p>"She is helping with many issues. There is a lot to organise. The burial needs to be sorted out.</p><p>"The boy who died was not the only person in the water. It's just happened so quickly. They are in a state of absolute shock."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000602678614.jpg><p>A Durham Police spokesperson said: "A 15-year-old boy who died after getting into difficulty in the River Tees, at Broken Scar, Darlington, has been named.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"Anas El-Rafai, of Darlington, was last seen shortly after 5pm yesterday after entering the water.</p><p>"Sadly, his body was found nearby shortly before midnight.
