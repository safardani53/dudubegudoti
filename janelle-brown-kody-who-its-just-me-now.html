I’m just not. I just don’t need this.”</p><p>“In the last 18 months, I’ve realized that I’m pretty good. I’m independent, and I’m not going to stand here and be yelled at. I just don’t need it. I don’t deserve it and I don’t need it.”</p><p>Rumors have been running rampant for months that she’s left him.</p><p>Just a couple of days ago, an anonymous source told In Touch “Janelle is a strong independent woman and realized <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she can do it on her own</a>,” and that she “outgrew” Kody.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And of course we can’t forget that memorable moment where Gwen, Christine’s daughter, stated on social media that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kody was only with Meri and Robyn</a> these days.</p><p>At this point, it feels like we’re really just waiting on an official statement, either on the show or on social media.</p><p>But it turns out that Janelle has made a little statement over on Instagram … and it’s pretty darn interesting.</p><p>In the past, Janelle’s Instagram bio mentioned being a wife and a mother, so pretty standard stuff, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Earlier this year, she changed it to read “I’m just over here living my best life. I ❤️ shoes but can’t figure out how to wear them fashionably (Ask my kids).”</p><p>Fans noticed it, and of course it was interesting — at that point, the rumors had definitely already started, and this would have been shortly after the footage we’re seeing now was filmed.</p><p>But fans also noticed that recently, she changed her bio up again, this time to read “Just me” along with a big smiley face.</p><p>So that’s pretty telling, huh?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Some Sister Wives sleuths have pointed out that just before <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine announced her split from Kody</a>, she made a similar change to her Instagram bio.</p><p>Others think that she’s referring to the fact that her youngest child, Savannah, just turned 18, so perhaps she’s moved out and she’s just telling us that she’s living completely by herself now.</p><p>Another popular theory is that this change is sort of a combination of these two things, that maybe she has left him, but wanted to wait until all her children were grown before making it official.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Either way, Janelle has to be aware of the rumors and of how bad her relationship with Kody looks on the show, so changing her bio like this seems pretty pointed.</p><p>Could this finally be the end for Kody and his second wife?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z%2FcLbAp5ylpJVir7O71qdkpKeUrnq4tM5moK2rXZ%2FCtMCMppxmpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
