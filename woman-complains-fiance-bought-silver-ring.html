The promise of spending life with each other is much more important than the aesthetics of a ring"</p><p>And while it's entirely possible that the TikToker's ring post was a joke, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several of her relationship-themed uploads seem to be</a>, the debate around engagement rings and the people who care about them has raged on and probably will continue for as long as people are getting married.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @keely1123</span></figure><p>There are throngs of men who have spoken out against the idea of plopping down a ton of cash on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ring simply because diamond companies invested heavily into marketing campaigns</a> convincing folks that these stones are precious and rare, when in reality <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there are other gemstones that surpass diamonds in beauty and exclusivity</a>.</p><p>The psychology of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">engagement rings</a> and what they say about one's partner has often been discussed as well: while they have their naysayers who point out that most bling-hungry brides-to-be are mindless zombies being hoodwinked by great ads and collective social pressure to floss for everyone but the person they claim to love, there are others who say that the personal attention given <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to an engagement ring during a proposal speaks volumes about a person's feelings for their beloved</a>.</p><p>What do you think? Are engagement rings really big deals? Do you even think a ring is necessary? Will a simple band do? Or do you want to wear something that looks like it could hold hidden powers as long as you utter the correct ancient phrase and are pure of heart?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mmqiloKGuqrrSZp2imZ6Ysm6uzq6eoaxdqLatwsSrZKuhnpw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
