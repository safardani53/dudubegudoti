A month later, the “Like a Boy” coroner informed&nbsp;fans of her plan to drop back down to her pre-baby weight. “48lbs to go! Starting the game plan tomorrow!! P.s. don’t know how easy it’s going be considering 3 baby’s now! Going to work really hard at this! Let’s go Mamma” she said. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Then in January</a>, Ciara shared that she lost 28 lbs after five months of hard work and would be continuing her weight loss journey&nbsp;with help from WW, formerly known as Weight Watchers. She stated in her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>, “This journey has been easy, stress free and fun! Especially juggling mommy life, work life, exercise, etc! The WW app has been a game changer!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>By June 15, Ciara had <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>finally reached</a> her incredible weight loss goal. To announce the big news, Ciara posed in a&nbsp;copper two-piece leather outfit, with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a tie-front top</a> and two long sleek hair braids, in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebratory snapshot</a> on Instagram. “Goodbye to those last 10 lbs. I’ve been working on these past 5 weeks, Hello to me-pre baby weight!” she said. The mom of three went on to say that she was “so proud of myself,” adding, “Thank you to everyone for your support, we did it! If you believe in yourself and set goals, it’s all possible! Go for it! Go get it!.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5FtZpyhkaeubrjEmquhnaJisbOx0qxkp7GTYr2pu9OoqmavlZ60qcCMpaasq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
