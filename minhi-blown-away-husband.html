His website shows he has a long history as a successful glass blower. Originally from Kansas, he got a BFA in Sculpture and Glass from Emporia State University in 2007. Then in 2013, he earned an MFA in Sculpture and Glass from the University of Texas at Arlington.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 2012, Jesse and Minhi met at the Pilchuck Glass School. Soon after, they started their relationship, moved in together, and started an "artist compound." Here, they allowed other artists to live and work. They continued to work together and partnered with the brand <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Artful Ashes</a> to create "iconic glass memorials."</p><p>In 2019, Jesse was diagnosed with MPNST (malignanat peripherial nerve sheath tumor).

In the caption, she talked about the impact he had on her life.</p><p>"You have believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself, encouraged me, and lifted me up in my darkest days," Minhi said. "We’ve shared some of my most cherished memories, and you will forever have my whole heart. You have shown me abundant generosity and kindness despite my many shortcomings. I am grateful for your bountiful love and devotion."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Now, Minhi posts about Jesse and the work they started together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an Instagram post</a>, she compared her grief to "a slow drip like making a cold brew coffee, strong and dark."
