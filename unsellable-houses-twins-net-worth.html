By focusing on the properties that most realtors would glance right past, the twins are able to scoop up great deals that only require a bit of elbow grease to get to a point where it could net them a hefty return on investment.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Leslie Davis and Lyndsay Lamb</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Home renovators</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $1.5 million+</p><p>Leslie and Lyndsay are well-known HGTV reality stars thanks to their roles on the show Unsellable Houses.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">K5</a>, Leslie and Lyndsay have successfully sold hundreds of homes that were previously deemed unsellable.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"We left Re/Max and started <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lamb Real Estate</a>. We do have 9 agents through Lamb Real Estate, and this was actually our highest performing year; we sold over 300 homes this past year," Lyndsay explained to the publication during their 2021 interview. Naturally, home prices fluctuate greatly based on a variety of factors, but 300 homes in a year must have certainly netted the twins a substantial sum of money.</p><p>That isn't their only income stream either. "We opened up a retail business," Leslie explained. "So the items we get to use in the show we now get to sell," chimed in Lyndsay. â€œWe opened up a design firm so we get to help clients, not just on the show, but ... all of our clients."</p><p>Between real estate, retail, and reality fame, Leslie and Lyndsay are most definitely on solid financial ground as of the time of writing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqru0sculmJuklWK1sMHSnqpmrKeeu7R5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
