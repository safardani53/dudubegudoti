He was captain of the youth team and the best player every week.”</p><p>Manning saw Rice flourish as a centre-back and central midfielder who forced his way into the first team.</p><p>He made his Premier League debut at <a href=#>Burnley</a> in May 2017, a few days after leading West Ham’s youngsters to victory over Newcastle in a Premier League 2 promotion play-off final at St James’ Park.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a aria-label="FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS AND BONUSES NEW CUSTOMERS (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS & NEW CUSTOMER BONUSES</a></strong></p><p>But he came crashing down to earth following a 4-0 defeat at Liverpool on opening day of the 2018-19 season.</p><p>Pellegrini subbed him at half-time, axed him from the first-team squad and told him to train with Manning.</p><p>That is when Manning knew Rice was destined for great things.</p><p>He recalled: “Dec was the first one out, brought the balls out and was the best player in training. He collected the equipment at the end and went to do a player appearance when he could have been annoyed at not being selected.</p><p>“It summed up how much he loves football and was developing into a top professional.</p><p>“What struck me&nbsp;was his reading of the game and how cleanly he did the simple things.</p><p>“It wasn’t always about ‘Wow!’ moments but constantly making the right decisions and executing them to the highest level.”</p><p>Even without Rice, Manning is aware of the threat City face at the London Stadium.</p><p>Manning added: “The fact they will be formidable opponents is largely down to <a href=#>David Moyes</a>, who I briefly crossed paths with in my days at West Ham.</p><p>“You have to admire and respect what he’s achieved and the longevity of his career.”</p><p>While Rice’s attention will be focused on <a href=#>Arsenal’s tie with Liverpool</a> today, Manning insists he still epitomises everything that is good about West Ham’s ‘academy of football’.</p><p>He added: “Dec is a player West Ham should be really proud of.</p><p>“There was a very strong relationship between him and the fans, which is why Dec possibly stayed longer than other players might have.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“I don’t like talking too often about people I’ve worked with.
