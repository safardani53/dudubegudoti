The <a href=#>PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a> are still difficult to find for many (though they're increasingly becoming more common in stores) and those who preordered their <a href=#>Steam Deck</a> in 2021 are just now getting it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But if you've managed to get your hands on the Steam Deck, it's likely become a favorite console of yours.

Some players have already found ways to connect AirPods with their <a href=#>Xbox</a> and PlayStation consoles â€” and yes, there are ways to connect your AirPods to your Steam Deck.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, it's important to note that while players have found ways to connect the Bluetooth headphones to their console, the little pods won't work as a microphone. This means that if you're using AirPods, you'll get the audio input from the game, but you won't be able to chat with your friends. That being said, AirPods are a great option if they're all you have on hand at the time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Connecting your AirPods to your Steam Deck is actually incredibly simple.
