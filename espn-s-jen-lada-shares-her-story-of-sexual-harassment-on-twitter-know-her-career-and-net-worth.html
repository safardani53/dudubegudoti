During her early phase in the field of journalism, Lada had to deal with something that many might us can call it a nightmare.

He not only did that but also drank way too much and drove her to his house instead of taking her to her hotel. He even asked her to swim with him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Even though Lada informed the whole incident of the news director, no action was taken and the sports director still works there.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Check out the tweets of Jen Lada related to sexual harassment.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>To add to <a href=#>@lvzwestcott</a>'s harassment compilation......</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>1) I was 22 yo, graduated from Marquette and had just finished one year of a non-paid sports internship. I was waitressing to pay the bills.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>3) It was my first professional interview in the business. I was ecstatic.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>4) I was probably overwhelmed by the possibility of landing such an impressive job. Maybe even intimidated by the grandeur of the operation.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>5) Maybe the sports director sensed both of those things and pegged me as a vulnerable target. Or maybe he's just a prick.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>6) I interviewed, watched his early sportscast. I was impressed. He suggested we grab dinner but noted it wld have to be after his late show</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>7) I remember at the time, rationalizing this to myself "cmon, Jen sports are at night. This is the schedule. This is prob normal."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>8) The last thing I wanted to be viewed as was someone who was uninformed abt the business norms & couldn't go with the flow.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>9) 1st sign of impropriety: he took off his pants in front of me. He would later defend this as gauging my comfort w/nudity ie locker rooms</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>10) We later sat at the bar of the restaurant for dinner. He drank what I NOW know is an inappropriate amount of alcohol for a biz dinner.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>11) He said he would drive me back to my hotel. Instead, he drove me to his house. Wanted to show me his pool. I refuse to leave the car.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>12)U have to remember, despite this bs, I still wanted the job. So I am trying to walk fine line of nice but stern when asking 2B taken home</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>13)He suggests we go swim. My head is racing. I default to stupidly noting that I didn't bring a bathing suit. You can imagine the response.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>13)He suggests we go swim.

You can imagine the response.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>15)Finally, he relents & SPEEDS back to my hotel. he seems pissed. I am confused & uncomfortable & scared. But at least, I am out of his car</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>16)Not over. He calls my cell phone repeatedly trying to get me to change my mind. When I stop answering the calls, my room phone rings.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>17) I didn't get the job.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>18)Of course realizing my next move may be interpreted as sour grapes, I emailed the news director to let him know what went down that night</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>19)I remember writing "I'm not doing this for fame or infamy but this type of behavior can only be viewed as a liability to your company."</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>20) Remember, this is my VERY FIRST interview at a tv station. And it's a big one. I am very much thinking "what have I gotten myself into?"</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>21) News director said it would be addressed. He has since moved to a station elsewhere. Sports director still works there. And here I am.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>22)This account might seem kinda self-indulgent now. But I just thought I'd add my experience to the bunch.</p>— Jen Lada (@JenLada) <a href=#>August 22, 2016</a><p>That’s really sad. Don’t you think so? But, this brave lady has been able to overcome this and is doing really good in her career. Respect!! All of us should come out and reveal if they have been sexually harassed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><strong>Jen Lada Career and Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Lada is a Marquette University graduate.
