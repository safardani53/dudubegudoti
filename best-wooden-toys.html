Many are also seeking out alternatives to plastic toys that a) seem to take up every inch of space in their homes and b) aren't very good for the planet.</p><p>Wooden toys never go out of style, from the first set of wooden blocks you give a baby to the wooden kitchen set you purchase for toddlers looking to practise 'baking'. Wooden toys are also built to last, so can easily be passed down from one child to the next - or from a grandparent to their grandchildren.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RB-COMP-WOODEN-TOYS.jpg><p>While wooden toys used to serve more of a background role in a child's play space, they're now front and centre. It could be that they're gorgeous and very Instagrammable, better for the planet, non-toxic...</p><p>It's also that as toy brands innovate and experiment, wooden toys aren't just the ones that adults want to have on display. Toys like rainbow stacking blocks, wooden books, wooden doll's houses (that we'd quite like to live in ourselves) have tons of appeal for kids, too.</p><p>One wooden toy maker that every parent should have on their radar is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Muro</a>: a toy slash educational activity centre, it's made of rubberwood (a waste product that works well in durable toys) and comes as either a cube or a wall board covered with various toys that transform it into a bespoke activity centre to suit your child's age and interests and adapt with them as they grow.</p><p>Other brands that have a dedicated wooden toy selection include GLTC, Le Toy Van, Djeco, Melissa & Doug and JoJo Maman Bébé, which has an extensive collection of wooden toy play sets with a big emphasis on pretend food play (you can even get a wooden Christmas dinner set for your little one).</p><p>Petit Collage is another wooden toy brand to watch: the eco-friendly award-winning brand makes wooden kids' toys out of recycled and renewable materials, in bold and bright colours and patterns, for babies and beyond.</p><p>This article and featured products have been independently chosen by Sun journalists.

Easy to build and it’s just beautiful! Lovely sweet details such as the hot and cold tap, rotating oven knobs with cute labels, shelves on back of the cupboard door, tiles and raised hob rings.
