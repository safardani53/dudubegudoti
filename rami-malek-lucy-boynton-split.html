That means I was a misogynist. That I didn’t f*** with Taylor Swift’. Because I went to her concert and I was like, ‘This person is an incredible songwriter, an incredible performer, and any-body who says anything else?</p><p>“‘Like, they have issues.

She is in talks with crisis managers and lawyers every day.”</p><p>One of the dancers in the sexual harassment lawsuit, Arianna Davis, said of Lizzo on Channel 4 News: “I do look up to her for using her platform to address issues that other artists were doing, but knowing her now... it was performative.”</p><p>Lizzo hit back at her accusers in a statement on Thursday, saying: “These sensationalised stories are coming from former employees who have already publicly admitted that they were told their behaviour on tour was inappropriate and unprofessional.” But the dancers’ attorney fired back: “Given that Lizzo is denying that any of this ­happened, let’s take it to trial.</p><p>“More witnesses are coming forward every day corroborating the plaintiffs’ allegations, so we are looking forward to facing Lizzo and her team in court.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Spongebob aims at BoJo in show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/spongebob-musical-lewis-cornay-825459100.jpg><p>THE SpongeBob Musical has taken a surprisingly political turn, by poking fun at Downing Street’s handling of the Covid pandemic.</p><p>The show – starring Lewis Cornay, pictured, as the lead as well as singer <a href=#>Gareth Gates</a> and telly’s Tom Read Wilson alternating for the role of Squidward – sees the land of Bikini Bottom threatened by potential destruction – and “Drowning Street” struggling to cope. Just like the slogan, “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives,” they issue guidance to “Stay home, protect the kelp, save yourselves.”</p><p>As disaster breaks, the mayor says: “Everything is going to be OK. Everyone knows you can always trust the government.” But later on, in scenes reminiscent of Boris Johnson, the mayor admits: “I should apologise for my flagrant abuses of power. Mistakes were made.”</p><p>Nominated for 12 Tony awards on Broadway, the hilarious production will run at Queen Elizabeth Hall on London’s South Bank until August 27 with further dates in Plymouth and Newcastle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/editorial-use-gemma-collins-announced-836009662.jpg><p>THERE’S almost no product left that <a href=#>Gemma Collins</a> hasn’t put her face to, and she doesn’t give an Edam about what she does to pay her bills.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>The reality star’s latest deal has seen her sign up as pizza chain Papa Johns’ new “Head of Cheese” – and posed for this snap to announce the tie-in.</p><p>Gemma, who has previously done deals with Wizz Air, Surf washing powder and Walkers crisps, said: “Darlings, there’s no challenge The GC can’t rise to.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">CHARTS</h3></p><p><strong>SINGLES</strong></p><p>1.
