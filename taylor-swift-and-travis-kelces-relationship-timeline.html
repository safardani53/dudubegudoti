Because Swift does not do meet and greets “before or after the show,” he was unable to hand her “[a bracelet] with my [phone] number on it.”</p><p>Swift later showed her interest in Travis by<a href=#> accepting an invite</a> to a Chiefs vs. Chicago Bears game in September 2023. According to Kelce, the duo were connected well before that NFL game, thanks to a mysterious person in Swift’s camp.</p><p>“There were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said], ‘Yo! Did you know he was coming?’ I had somebody playing Cupid,” Travis told <a href=# rel=noopener>WSJ. Magazine</a> in November 2023. “She [later] told me exactly what was going on and how I got lucky enough to get her to reach out.”</p><p>By October 2023, things were heating up between the pair on a more public level.</p><p>“They’re really happy. They’re not saying they’re in love yet. But it’s obvious to her friends they’re heading in that direction,” a source told Us Weekly at the time. “Friends think they’re in love.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see how Swift and Travis’ relationship has developed:</p><h3>July 2023</h3><p>Travis attended Swift’s<a href=#> Eras Tour</a> at her Kansas City stop in Missouri.</p><h3>July 26, 2023</h3><p>Later that month, Travis opened up about how much he enjoyed her concert on an episode of&nbsp; the “New Heights” podcast. “It was an unbelievable show. Kansas City showed out … Everybody was dressed in pink and purple, going crazy for her,” he gushed. “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. I wanted to give her <a href=#>[a bracelet] with my number</a> on it.”</p><p class=p1>In December 2023, Swift revealed that she heard Kelce “very adorably put me on blast” in his “metal as hell” podcast episode and decided to reach out.</p><h3>September 24, 2023</h3><p>Shortly after several sports outlets reported that Swift and Travis were seeing each other, Swift fueled romance rumors when she attended her first Kansas City Chiefs game in Travis’ private suite. She supported the NFL star by wearing a Chiefs jacket and <a href=#>cheering him on</a> with his mom, Donna. She even appeared to shout “Let’s f–king go,” following a big play.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-an-Travis-Kelce-s-Relationship-Timeline-From-Chiefs-Games-to-Romantic-Date-Nights-420.jpg><p>After the game, they were spotted leaving the locker room together. For the outing, Travis wore <a href=#>a funky blue and white denim set</a>. The brand, KidSuper Studios, saw Travis <a href=#>wearing the ensemble</a> with Swift and renamed it the “1989 Bedroom Painting Denim Jacket,” as a reference to her album 1989.

I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”</p><h3>September 26, 2023</h3><p>Days after Swift attended the game, multiple sources told Us the pair are taking <a href=#>their relationship slow</a>. “They have been on a few dates and Taylor is smitten with him,” the insider said. “It is not serious, and Taylor is having fun right now.” A second source confirmed, “They’re getting closer and closer every day.”</p><p>Another insider noted, they are “enjoying each other’s company and getting to know each other.” A fourth source confirmed that they had hung out “twice” so far.</p><h3>September 27, 2023</h3><p>Travis reflected on Swift’s appearance at his game, calling her <a href=#>brave for attending</a>.

That was pretty ballsy.”</p><p>That same day, Jason made an appearance on SportsRadio 94 WIP and commented on his brother’s budding romance. “It was fun watching the whole world take it in, to be honest with you,” he said. “I would say with this one, it definitely seems like he is going above and beyond to<a href=#> be a gentleman</a>.”</p><h3>October 1, 2023</h3><p>Swift rooted for Travis at a Chiefs vs. New York Jets game <a href=#>with BFFs</a> <a href=#><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a>,<a href=#> <strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a>. She even hugged Travis’ mom, Donna, during the game.</p><h3>October 3, 2023</h3><p>A source revealed in an issue of Us that Swift was “was low-key and low-maintenance” while watching Travis defeat the Jets.

She likes that he’s a normal, nice guy. He’s down-to-earth and isn’t affected by fame. She also thinks he’s hot.”</p><p>A separate insider gushed, “Travis is completely smitten.”</p><h3>October 10, 2023</h3><p>One day after Travis’ 34th birthday, sources told Us<a href=#> Swift flew to Kansas City</a> “to see Travis.” The pair enjoyed a “chill night,” per the insider.</p><h3>October 12, 2023</h3><p>Swift supported her man at the Chiefs vs. Denver Broncos game. For the event, she <a href=#>rocked a Chiefs windbreaker</a> — gifted to her by Travis’ friend<a href=#><strong> Erin Andrews</strong></a> from her WEAR clothing line — featuring white stripes, the team’s name in a cursive font and their logo. She again enjoyed the match with Donna, and met Travis’ dad, <a href=#><strong>Ed Kelce</strong></a>.</p><p>Donna, for her part, sported Eras Tour-inspired <a href=#>friendship bracelets</a> with colorful letter beads.</p><h3>October 13, 2023</h3><p>An insider told Us the duo’s relationship was “going great.”</p><p>“It’s still so new, but they really like each other,” the source told Us. “They both want to try to<a href=#> see each other when they can</a> and they’re both understanding of each other’s schedules.”</p><h3>October 14, 2023</h3><p>Travis surprised fans with an appearance on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>, appearing in a sketch that took a dig at Swift’s famous ex-boyfriends.</p><p>In the skit, which included host<a href=#><strong> Pete Davidson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kenan Thompson</strong></a>, <strong>Curt Menefee</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Mikey Day</strong></a> and more, the actors played sports commentators who quickly got sidetracked by Swift’s appearances at NFL games.</p><p>The men praised Travis for being a better suitor for Swift than exes<a href=#> <strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Matty Healy</strong></a> were. (Swift and Alwyn <a href=#>dated for six years</a> before Us confirmed their split in April. Following the breakup, she had a brief romance with Healy.)</p><p>Thompson then told the group, “Knock it off, people tuned in for football, OK?

He “goes out of his way to make Taylor feel special in any way he can … Taylor couldn’t believe the massive bouquet of flowers Travis sent to her just because.”</p><p>“He makes her feel safe and protected,” the source said, noting that he still <a href=#>lets her feel bejeweled</a>.

They’re not saying they’re in love yet. But it’s obvious to her friends they’re heading in that direction … <a href=#>Friends think they’re in love</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-an-Travis-Kelce-s-Relationship-Timeline-From-Chiefs-Games-to-Romantic-Date-Nights-417.jpg><p>The source explained that the pair have already planned how to stay in touch when she returns to her Eras Tour, adding,&nbsp;“He’s going to see her when she’s back on tour. That’s already planned. And when she gets a break, she’ll see him. It’s going so well because it’s easy and nothing is complicated.”</p><h3>October 22, 2023</h3><p>Swift enjoyed the Chiefs vs. Los Angeles Chargers<a href=#> game alongside</a> quarterback <a href=#><strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong></a>’ wife, <a href=#><strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong></a>.

And we’re just proud of each other.”</p><p class=p1>The musician also gushed about <a href=#><span class=s1>missing out on watching football</span></a> in years past and not caring about the “dads, Brads and Chads” who get upset about the NFL highlighting her in their game coverage.</p><h3>December 10, 2023</h3><p>Swift attended her first the Chiefs game where they lost.
