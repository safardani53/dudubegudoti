Close call!)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Gabrielle tried several times to break our grip and run away from us,” the security personnel added.</p><p>Once Gabbie was finally detained, the cops were called, and the real fireworks began.</p><p>Police removed her handcuffs so that they could use their own, and Egan seized the opportunity to try and escape.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This time, she attempted to kick a police officer in the junk, but once again, her kick was deflected with a well-placed knee.</p><p>Perhaps furious with her own inaccuracy, Egan began to berate and threaten the arresting officers, screaming that she would "f–k [them] up,” and saying “watch what would happen if [they] were not in uniform and on the street."</p><p>Gabbie was booked on two counts of battery by a prisoner on a first responder and interference with a public officer by threat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She was later released on her own recognizance.</p><p>“The preceding 21 years of life prior to this incident have been void of any sort of contact with law enforcement or any participation or association with anything criminal in nature,” reads a statement from Egan’s attorney.</p><p>“As to date, no formal charges have been filed against her, and no official discovery has been turned over regarding this matter," the lawyer continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Ms. Egan looks forward to addressing the allegations in a fair, criminal proceeding, where we are hopeful her name will be cleared and restored to the exemplary individual she is and who individuals closest to her will also unequivocally attest to.”&nbsp;</p><p>Gabbie was probably advised not to speak out on this matter, but amazingly, she couldn’t stop herself from making a TikTok video about her Vegas escapades.</p><p>“I’ve been taking a step back and working on myself,” Gabbie said in the video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Seems like there is always some sort of set back in my life, but just gotta keep pushing through it! Sending good vibes to everyone.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fans who commented on the clip weren’t so sympathetic, with several advising her to “be accountable and apologize to the police officer.”</p><p>“Aw yeah,” another wrote. “Take a step back so you don’t end up with as many mug shots as Jenelle.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Egan also seems to be suggesting that her violent beavior was the result of someone slipping something into one of the many cocktails she consumed that day.</p><p>“Las Vegas photo dump–reminder to keep your drinks close to you at all times and never let them out of your sight when drinking anywhere,” she wrote on Instagram. “We live in a scary world. Xoxo.”&nbsp;</p><p>Wise words — but because that advice is accompanied by pics of Gabbie consuming what appears to be a dozen different drinks, it’s possible that alcohol was the only inflammatory ingredient she imbibed.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WFcLPAm5minV2atKK6jKOcp52cobJusdWapaxlkpuzbq3Rq5ysrJWZeqKy056pZpmjqK62uNOipaBlk6S9cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
