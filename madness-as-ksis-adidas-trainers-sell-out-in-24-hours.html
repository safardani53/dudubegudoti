The black and red high ‘Forum Hi’ high tops were released on April 8th and were priced at £90, but they are no longer available.</p><p>Today (April 8th), the internet celebrity took to Twitter to reveal that the trainers have completely sold out and are now selling for up to triple their RRP on reseller sites…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ks-1.jpg><h2>KSI’s Adidas Trainers Sell Out</h2><p>KSI took to Twitter on Saturday morning (April 9th) to announce that his KSI x Adidas Forum Hi collaboration is completely sold out.</p><p>“RIP. “Everything is sold out lol,” he wrote, alongside a screenshot of the Adidas website that says “out of stock.” He also posted the same screenshot to his Instagram Story, captioning it “Madness.”</p><p>The trainers, which feature the sports brand’s iconic three stripes in red, were released on Friday (April 8th) and quickly sold out. KSI revealed the trainers were “limited edition” when he announced them on April 1st. That means no more stock will be released, and the shoe is now permanently sold out.</p><h2>They Are Already Reselling For Triple The RRP</h2><p>KSI’s trainers are already selling for more than twice their RRP on reselling sites like StockX, as expected. The 28-year-old shared another screenshot, revealing that the sneakers were sold out at Adidas, Size?, and JD. He then displayed the Forum Hi’s for £116 on StockX, £250 on Laced, and £245 on Klekt, with the caption “Yeah it’s a long day.” KSI also revealed that he is bidding on a pair of trainers in his size on StockX. Isn’t it possible for him to get his own collaboration for free?</p><h2>KSI Signs Trainers At Adidas London Flagship</h2><p>On Friday, KSI was signing sneakers at the Adidas flagship store on London’s Oxford Street.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>KSI at Adidas’s London Store today, for the launch of the Adidas Forum Hi x KSI collab 👟📸 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/krNIanf2gl</a></p><p>— Nick Brooker 📸 (@NckPix) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">April 8, 2022</a></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmpyemsC0ecCsZKSrmah6orDInZisZaSnrqq6xKuqZquVobluu9StZKKmXWeBbrTOrqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
