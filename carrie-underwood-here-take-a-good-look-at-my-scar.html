"And he’s the bet thing in the world."</p><p>"I’m like, ‘if we can never have any other kids, that’s okay, because he’s amazing.’"</p><p>She said that she felt like she couldn’t complain or be angry because her life is so good in so many ways, but when she had another scare during this pregnancy?</p><p>"I got mad," she admitted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/carrie-underwood-looking-her-best-680x1024.jpg><p>Thankfully, the scare turned out to be nothing, and her pregnancy is going along normally and healthily.</p><p>But still, it’s understandable that she’s still feeling lots of emotions about everything.</p><p>Especially since last year, she experienced another traumatic event when <a href=#>she had a fall that resulted in some pretty serious injuries</a>.</p><p>She broke her wrist, and that required physical therapy and lots of new metal parts in her arm.</p><p>Carrie told fans about that part after it happened, but it took her longer to reveal that when she fell, she also injured her face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/carrie-underwood-on-acm-stage-682x1024.jpg><p>There was a cut above her lip that took between 40 and 50 stitches to close, and for a while, she wasn’t sure how the healing would go.</p><p>She laid low for a few months, and it wasn’t until April, five months after the accident, that <a href=#>she felt comfortable getting back onstage</a>.</p><p>But now, almost a year after her fall, she’s confident to share close-up selfies with her scar in plain sight.</p><p>Like this one:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/carrie-underwood-on-acm-stage-682x1024.jpg><p>The look is from her "Love Wins" music video that she released last month, but people aren’t talking about her makeup in reaction to this photo.</p><p>Nope, they’re talking about the scar.</p><p>"Still pretty even with the scar!" one of her followers wrote, like that little thing could possibly take away any of her beauty.</p><p>"Love that scar!" another person told her, which, OK, cool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Someone said "Whoa that scar is huuuuuge," which seems a little insensitive.</p><p>There were some people who turned this picture into a negative thing, like Carrie has just turned into "Scar Girl" now.</p><p>"Why make a big deal out of a scar?" one of those people criticized. "It’s only on the surface which does not affect u as a singer."</p><p>"This world is not as superficial as what you think!!!!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But then again, maybe it is, because lots and lots of other commenters felt that she’d gotten lip injections because of those photo.</p><p>As one of her fans said in defense, "After her accident she has to have extensive plastic surgery to repair a huge gash that tore through her upper lip into her left nostril."</p><p>"That’s why her lip is larger."</p><p>But not everyone bought that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Look, maybe that’s what happened, or maybe she did decide to get some lip injections.</p><p>Maybe her lips just look bigger because of the way she’s posing in the photo.</p><p>Does it really matter?</p><p>At the end of the day, Carrie is still a good person who is really, really beautiful.</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>31 Photos of Carrie Underwood Being Gorgeous and Awesome</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>And isn’t that what matters?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2Z9cK%2FAq6minV2qu6Wx0bCmqJxdnbKzsYytmKSdXZZ6qLvOnWSlp5%2BgeqLAjKawZquTlr9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
