Others don’t, and then fade from memory.</p><p>And then there’s Danielle Mullins, whose infamous relationship with Mohamed Jbali&nbsp;is still haunting them both long after the fact.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>Even out of the context of Mohamed Jbali, Danielle is just … quite the character. With a very shady past, as In Touch points out.</p><p>How shady, though? And what, you might wonder, is she up to now? Is she in a relationship? What’s next for her?&nbsp;</p><p>The whole point of being a reality star is to become famous and accumulate fans (while cashing a check).</p><p>When you know that your fame and fortune depend upon your fans, you want to give them shout-outs on social media and promote yourself.</p><p>Danielle Mullins goes a little above and beyond what you’d normally expect.</p><p>Sure, she promotes herself well on social media, but did you know that she happily sends fans autographed photos of herself?</p><p>If that’s something that you want in your life, don’t be shy about it — let her know. (She says on her Instagram to message or email her for details.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>You know, Danielle’s social media was one of the divisive issues that <a href=#>cost Danielle Mullins her makeover show</a>.</p><p>While the media company that dropped her like a bad habit claimed that it was over her "unstable behavior," <a href=#>Danielle disagreed</a>.</p><p>Apparently the media company had completely taken over Danielle’s social media accounts and begun posting clickbait ads — without Danielle getting to participate in that monetization.</p><p>She likes to post family photos and links to articles about herself.</p><p>Our guess? They’re both probably telling the truth as they see it.</p><p>Danielle isn’t getting her makeover show, but she’s still determined to lose weight — even if no agency or network is willing to broadcast it.</p><p>If she does it herself, we’re not really sure how effectively she’ll be able to monetize it … but maybe she’ll come up with something.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Reality television stardom isn’t Danielle’s only life plan, however.</p><p>She really wants to be a nurse, and has been taking courses in the hopes of getting her nursing license.</p><p>Of course, she might hit a bit of an obstacle — because, as fans have pointed out to her, you can’t get a nursing license with certain criminal histories.</p><p>And <a href=#>Danielle Mullins has a criminal past</a> that, quite frankly, 90 Day Fiance barely even touched on.</p><p>Danielle has responded by saying:</p><p>"My criminal charges don’t count because they are misdemeanors, not felonies."</p><p>That’s interesting, because it was our understanding that her 2005 arrest came with felony charges of theft and forgery.</p><p>But what matters, in this context, is that she was never found guilty of any felonies — the charges were dropped to misdemeanor theft.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Again, that was all a very long time ago — but some fans say that Danielle hasn’t exactly turned over a new leaf.</p><p>Remember, Mohamed Jbali accused her of misusing his identity and stealing his money shortly into their ill-fated marriage.</p><p>Honestly, those allegations were the least of the couple’s problems.</p><p>In fact, <a href=#>Danielle Mullins is suing Mohamed Jbali</a> in the hopes of making up for the money that she says she spent on him.</p><p>We have no idea how successful this venture will be.</p><p>Remember, she first tried to get their marriage annulled — in order to not only end their marriage but get him deported back to Tunisia.</p><p>Some fans accused her of being overly spiteful. She had accused Mohamed of cheating multiple times during their brief marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In the end, Danielle and Mohamed got divorced … though <a href=#>Mohamed Jbali might get deported anyway</a>, based upon the late paperwork that he’s revealed on Instagram.</p><p>Let’s hope not, though.</p><p>Something that we should address is the "theory" espoused by some 90 Day Fiance viewers that Danielle is in some way "mentally challenged."</p><p>They point out things like her poor eyesight (her glasses look pretty heavy-duty), her behavior, and the alleged foul body odor that Mohamed Jbali accused her of having.</p><p>First of all, some sort of "remote diagnosis" would be irresponsible for an actual psychologist without examining Danielle. So that whole discussion isn’t just rude — it’s a fool’s errand.</p><p>But poor eyesight is just poor eyesight, and it runs in some families. It has no bearing on intelligence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Her behavior — the alleged stealing and general shadiness about money — might speak to impulsiveness and a lack of forethought about the consequences of her actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Some might say that bringing Mohamed Jbali across the world because she wanted sex was using the same sort of judgment.</p><p>But you don’t need any kind of cognitive impairment to do that, folks. People make terrible decisions every single day.</p><p>And as for the alleged body odor? That could be just about anything.</p><p>Maybe she just needs a new deodorant, or maybe she has some sort of infection, or maybe it’s her clothes or her house or Mohamed’s imagination.</p><p>Wisely, Danielle has never commented on any of these rumors.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>90 Day Fiance: Which Couples Are (Somehow) Still Together?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Finally, Danielle Mullins says that she is in a relationship.</p><p>But don’t expect to see her current gentleman caller any time soon.</p><p>Danielle says that it is a long-distance relationship (uh oh, isn’t that how things with Mohamed Jbali started?) with a man who is averse to fame and would not want to appear on 90 Day Fiance or any other reality series.</p><p>We … well, we sure do look forward to learning more about this mystery man.</p><p>We’ll say that much.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z9cLDAp6CepJyaeq7By6Wgp6tdqr2lrdOeZLCgkal6qr%2BMrJ%2BeZaWlerW7jKemsGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
