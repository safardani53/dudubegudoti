Maci’s breakup with Kyle came the same week as the unfortunate news of her grandfather, but Ryan stepped up to lend a helping hand!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Dalis and Maci go head-to-head</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tension grew to a boiling point when Dalis came out to join them on stage, and she accused Maci of flirting with Ryan and trying to turn him against her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“You, you said, ‘you’d have a better time with me,’” Dalis said, and Maci fired back, “I really don’t think you want to go there, because then I’m going to bring something (up) that you really don’t want to hear.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Although Ryan played dumb to the whole ordeal, Maci dropped a bombshell — it was Ryan who initiated the flirtatious conversation during their vacation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I was at dinner with my girlfriends, Ryan called me, said him and Dalis were fighting, and that he wanted to come to my room, and hang out with us and go out with us,” Maci said. She then said Ryan denied the whole conversation, and only told Dalis that Maci had been texting him the whole time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Ryan’s new girlfriend was not pleased, and accused Maci of still “trying to get with Ryan, texting Ryan.” She added, “I’ve seen the text messages.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>It was very clear throughout this final season that Maci still had some jealousy toward Dalis — remember when she said she “didn’t have a chance” during their beach vacation? — and it seems the resentment hasn’t completely gone away.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Maci and Kyle are back together, and Ryan and Dalis are still going strong, but as co-parents to one toddler caught in the middle, it looks like the arguments are far from over.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Check out the clip below:</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>What do YOU think of Dalis and Maci’s exchange <strong>HollyMoms</strong>?</p><h3>— Christina Stiehl</h3><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>More Teen Mom news:</strong></p><li><a href=#>‘Teen Mom’ Reunion Part 2: Kyle Reveals Why He Cheated On Maci</a></li><li>‘Teen Mom’ Amber Portwood Loses 25 Pounds In Jail</li><li>‘Teen Mom’ Reuinion Preview: Dalis & Maci Fight Over Ryan</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWliZH16e5BrZq2dlaN6rrvMZqmerZ6evK95zJqaomWSpLysu9StZJ%2BkmafBbr7YmqVmnZSsrrOw0mabmqSZqHqku82nnKWkXZ%2ByorjOrqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
