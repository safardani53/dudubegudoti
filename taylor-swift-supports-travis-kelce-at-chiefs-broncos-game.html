She wore her hair pulled back in a casual ponytail. She was later spotted in the athlete’s private box alongside his mom, <a href=#><strong>Donna Kelce</strong></a>.</p><p>However, the singer wasn’t the only celebrity spotted at the game. <a href=#><strong>Rob Lowe</strong></a> made headlines with his appearance, especially when wearing a “Where’s Taylor?” hat while sitting in the stands. Lowe, 59, was joined by comedian <a href=#><strong>Wanda Sykes</strong></a> on the field as they posed for pictures ahead of the game to celebrate their new Atkins’ “Who Knew?” commercial debuting during the broadcast.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href=#>Swift skipped Kelce’s away game</a> against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, October 8. Although his team won 27-20, <a href=#>Kelce sustained an ankle injury</a> when he slipped on the turf at U.S. Bank Stadium during the second quarter. He returned later in the game and scored a touchdown, but his ailment made his status questionable for the Broncos match-up, despite the fact that he continued to practice in the days leading up to it.</p><p>Chiefs coach <strong>Andy Reid</strong> gave an <a href=#>update on Kelce</a> prior to the game. “He’s got quite a little bit of treatment on it and he’s feeling better, which is good,” he said during a Tuesday, October 10, press conference. “I’m just going to see, see how he moves around, see how he feels. He’s always been honest with me on things like that, and just see how he does.”</p><p>While Kelce has been recovering from his injury, Swift has been busy preparing for the <a href=#>release of her Eras Tour concert film</a>. She <a href=#>attended the movie’s premiere</a> on Wednesday, October 11, shutting down The Grove in Los Angeles to meet fans and watch the flick with them in theaters. She also announced via Instagram that she would <a href=#>be “opening up early access showings”</a> on Thursday due to “unprecedented demand.”</p><p>Despite Swift and Kelce’s packed schedules, they have found time to meet up regularly. She caused a frenzy when she <a href=#>attended his home game</a> against the Chicago Bears on September 24, and she showed her support for him again one week later when his team <a href=#>took on the New York Jets</a> in New Jersey, bringing along her A-list friends — including <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Hugh Jackman</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a> — to root for Kelce from a private suite.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly exclusively revealed that <a href=#>Swift then flew to Kansas City</a> on Friday, October 6, “to see Travis,” one day after he celebrated his birthday. The same day as Swift’s visit, Kelce gushed to reporters that he <a href=#>felt “even more on top of the world”</a> now than he did when he won the Super Bowl in February.</p><p>Indeed, a source told Us earlier this month that Kelce is “completely smitten” with Swift, while a second insider shared that the pair “talk every day” as their relationship develops. “Taylor’s really enjoying getting to know Travis,” the second source said. “They’re taking it day by day, but <a href=#>she has high hopes</a>. She likes that he’s a normal, nice guy. He’s down-to-earth and isn’t affected by fame. She also thinks he’s hot.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1edKup6mnoqnAbsDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaYrWWTnbamstJmmaunnpi8tHnGmqSeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
