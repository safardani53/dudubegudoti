The 2016 Netflix reboot centers on Danny's daughter, D.J. (Candace Cameron Bure), who is now a thirtysomething widow bringing up three kids of her own with the help of her sister Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and childhood BFF Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber). "I really wanted to revisit the show in a new, fresh, modern way," Cameron Bure tells PEOPLE. "I've got to have a lot of input on my character, to decide what D.J. would be doing now. I'm really comfortable with the way it's working out." Expect a love triangle between D.J., a guy from her past and a hunky new prospect – plus, a potential romantic match for Kimmy!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-john-stamos-is-way-behind-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>JOHN STAMOS IS WAY BEHIND IT</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy John Stamos</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stamos, who is reprising his role as Uncle Jesse, broke news of the 13-episode spin-off during an April <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jimmy Kimmel Live</a> appearance, and he's been keeping fans <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>up to date on the show's progress</a> ever since.

"They've never closed the door to anything. I think the only thing that's changed, once we've done the show now, it doesn't seem like this gaping hole," executive producer Bob Boyett tells PEOPLE.
