And Marcus was doing things that, you know, a married man probably shouldn’t do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Marcus confessed to trying to juggle “five to 10 women” back then, prompting Taryn to separate from her spouse for about a year.</p><p>During this time apart, Marcus met India.</p><p>He then started talking to Taryn again and somehow managed to convinced both women that all three of them should just live together.</p><p>“I gave [the arrangement] like a month or two and so now, I know her and I like her,” Taryn said on air of how the throuple formed.</p><p>” So, when Marcus brought up the idea of polygamy to me, I felt that it kind of made sense for us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Crazy, right? Especially with Marcus now trying to add yet another woman to his household?!?</p><p>And yet: This is not as crazy as the far more serious story/scandal surrounding Marcus Epps.</p><p>On October 25, 2020, there was a shooting at an after-hours night club in Cleveland.</p><p>Three people were reportedly shot by a man who was denied entry into the club by a bouncer, with one woman passing away from the injuries she sustained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As authorities learned upon investigating the incident, the building in which the shooting took place had been abandoned and condemned. It was technically owned by the state.</p><p>However, as the police digging continued, Taryn told the cops that she hosted the birthday party during which the shooting occurred — and Marcus then admitted to leasing the property.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>footage later emerged of Marcus helping to carry one of the victims out of the building</strong>.</p><p>The following image was taken from a police officer’s body camera on the scene:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>And here is a snippet from a local news report at the time:</p><p>Court records show the state foreclosed on the property three years ago, but the former owner is still making $1000 a month renting the building out to the “OCF group.”</p><p>According to an article in the News Herald, Euclid Councilman Marcus Epps lists his employer as the OFC group.</p><p>We compared the signature on the Woodhill Road lease, to Epps’s signature on his campaign finance statement on file with the state.</p><p>They appear to match. The OCF Group’s business license on file with the state lists Taryn Lindsey as the owner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Five months after the club shooting, Marcus — who served as a local councilman back then — got caught up in yet another scandal related to a property he was connected to.</p><p>On March 26, 2021, a 19-year-old woman suffered minor injuries after a house located in the 25000 block of Tungsten Avenue caught fire.</p><p>There was talk that the home in question violated certain housing code sections, but Epps told a 19 News that he was being set up.</p><p>“It’s all political, it’s all about at our next city council meeting I am trying to mandate body cameras by our officers,” Epps told the outlet two years ago.</p><p>“And the day before this search warrant was executed I was in the mayor’s office going in on them about a demolition project that started on Euclid Avenue and it is a catastrophe.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Epps — who ALSO owes over $12,000 in property taxes — was officially charged with multiple housing violations in January of this year.</p><p>So, there you have it. For now.</p><p>Sure looks like TLC has found another winner to whom it has given a salary and platform.</p><p>How shocking that someone with the personal history of Marcus Epps would turn out to be a bad guy and a possible criminal!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WDcLnAq5quq12avbG%2FjKycnqOZo7Ruv8isq56qXay2p7GMrKuaql2eu7e7y6%2BcnWWZo3q0tM6coqKml2K6trDEq2Ssm5GjsaK4jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
